# Paper.md Standardization Tools Summary

## Created Scripts

### 1. **paper_md_comprehensive_standardizer.py**
- Full-featured standardizer with tqdm progress bars
- Requires: `pip install openai tqdm pyyaml`
- Features: Batch processing, validation, detailed reports

### 2. **paper_md_standardizer_simple.py**
- Version without tqdm dependency
- Requires: `pip install openai pyyaml`
- Features: Same as comprehensive but simpler progress display

### 3. **paper_standardizer_minimal.py**
- No external dependencies (uses urllib)
- Works with standard Python library only
- Features: Basic standardization functionality

## Current Status

The scripts are created and ready, but we encountered some issues:

1. **Dependency Installation**: The environment has pip restrictions requiring virtual environments
2. **API Response Issues**: Kilocode API is working but returning partial/incomplete responses
3. **SSL Certificate**: We handled SSL certificate verification issues

## Next Steps

To use these tools:

### Option 1: Use with proper environment
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install openai tqdm pyyaml

# Run the comprehensive standardizer
python scripts/paper_md_comprehensive_standardizer.py --dry-run
```

### Option 2: Use the minimal version
```bash
# No dependencies needed
python scripts/paper_standardizer_minimal.py --papers abdallah_2021 --dry-run
```

### Option 3: Use existing tools
Since you mentioned you've used Gemini 2.5 Pro from Kilocode before, you might have existing scripts that already work with the API. The standardization prompts and structure I've defined can be integrated into your existing workflow.

## Manual Standardization

If the automated tools aren't working due to environment issues, you can:

1. Use the standardization template above
2. Manually process papers or use your existing Gemini setup
3. The key is ensuring consistency across all papers

## Important Notes

- Always backup papers before processing
- Validate against `hdm_research_papers_merged_20250710.csv`
- Keep cite_keys from folder names (for now)
- Preserve all original content
