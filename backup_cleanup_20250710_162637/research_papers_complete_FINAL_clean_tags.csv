abdallah_2021,Towards a GML-Enabled Knowledge Graph Platform,"Hussein Abdallah, Essam Mansour",2021,Yes,HIGH,"This paper is highly relevant as it proposes KGNet, a platform for on-demand graph machine learning (GML) as a service on top of RDF engines. This directly addresses the HDM project's need for integrating machine learning with knowledge graphs to enable intelligent reasoning over personal data. The focus on scalability, automated model training, and a GML-enabled query language (SPARQLML) provides a strong architectural blueprint for the HDM system.","The paper introduces KGNet, a platform that automates the training of GML models on knowledge graphs by using task-specific subgraphs. This approach improves scalability and accuracy for tasks like node classification and link prediction. It also proposes SPARQLML, a SPARQL-like query language that allows users to query and perform inference over KGs using the trained GML models.","This vision paper proposes KGNet, a platform that provides on-demand graph machine learning (GML) as a service on top of RDF engines. It aims to bridge the gap between GML frameworks and RDF data stores by automating the training of GML models on task-specific subgraphs of a knowledge graph. The platform introduces SPARQLML, a GML-enabled query language, to allow for querying and inferencing over KGs using the trained models, thereby improving scalability, accuracy, and accessibility of GML on knowledge graphs.","How can we seamlessly integrate graph machine learning (GML) models with RDF engines to enable scalable, on-demand training and querying of knowledge graphs for various prediction tasks?","The paper proposes the KGNet platform, which consists of two main components: GML-as-a-service (GMLaaS) and SPARQLML as a Service. GMLaaS automates the GML training pipeline by using a meta-sampling approach to extract task-specific subgraphs, selecting the optimal GML method based on budget constraints, and managing the trained models. SPARQLML as a Service provides a query interface that allows users to train, delete, and query GML models using a SPARQL-like syntax.","The experimental evaluation shows that training GML models on task-specific subgraphs identified by KGNet's meta-sampling approach significantly reduces training time and memory usage while maintaining comparable or even improved accuracy compared to training on the entire knowledge graph. For instance, on the DBLP dataset, KGNet achieved up to an 11% improvement in accuracy with at least a 22% reduction in memory and 27% reduction in training time.","The primary outcome is the proposal of the KGNet platform, a vision for a fully-fledged GML-enabled knowledge graph platform. The paper outlines the architecture, key components, and research challenges, and provides a proof-of-concept evaluation that demonstrates the feasibility and benefits of the proposed approach.","The paper is a vision paper, so the implementation is a prototype and not a fully mature system. The query optimization for SPARQLML is still an open research problem. The meta-sampling approach has been evaluated on a limited number of scenarios.","The integration of GML frameworks with RDF engines is a critical step towards building scalable and intelligent knowledge graph applications. By automating the GML pipeline and providing a high-level query language, platforms like KGNet can significantly lower the barrier for data scientists and developers to apply advanced machine learning techniques to knowledge graphs.","The paper identifies several research gaps, including the need for more advanced meta-sampling techniques, better methods for SPARQLML query optimization, and the development of comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating GML-enabled KG engines. There is also a need for more seamless integration between GML models and RDF engines to avoid the use of UDFs.","Future work includes developing more sophisticated meta-sampling approaches, creating advanced query optimization techniques for SPARQLML, and building comprehensive benchmarks to evaluate the performance of GML-enabled KG platforms. There is also an opportunity to explore the use of KGNet in various application domains beyond the ones presented in the paper.","The paper provides valuable insights into the architecture of a GML-enabled KG platform. The use of a meta-sampler to extract task-specific subgraphs is a key technique for improving scalability. The KGMeta graph, which stores metadata about trained models, is a clever way to enable seamless integration and query optimization.

While the paper is more conceptual, it provides a strong theoretical foundation for modeling human-technology interaction, which is central to the HDM's purpose. The discussion of how to model human information processing and intentionality can inform the design of the HDM's user model and its interaction paradigms.","The key insight of the paper is the necessity of shifting design focus from purely technical artifacts to a more holistic view that includes modeling human actions and intentions. The authors argue that Human Digital Twins, which are computational models of human interaction with technology, are essential tools for designing the intelligent systems of the future.

This PKG-based approach, which gives users control over their data model, was perceived as more accurate, novel, diverse, and useful than a traditional content-based system.","This paper proposes an educational recommender system that empowers students by allowing them to construct their own Personal Knowledge Graphs (PKGs). Students interact with learning materials and explicitly mark concepts they ""Did Not Understand"" (DNU). These DNU concepts form the basis of their PKG, which is then used to generate personalized recommendations for external learning resources (YouTube videos, Wikipedia articles). The system was evaluated through offline experiments and an online user study (N=31), comparing the PKG-based approach to a traditional content-based one. The results showed that while the content-based approach had slightly higher precision, the PKG-based approach was perceived more positively by users across several metrics, including accuracy, novelty, diversity, usefulness, and overall satisfaction.

(2) Users were more satisfied with the PKG-based system and had a higher intention to use it. (3) Giving users control over their learner model (by marking DNU concepts) was a major contributor to their satisfaction. (4) Offline, the keyphrase-based variants achieved higher semantic similarity scores, but online, the document-based variants had slightly better ranking accuracy (MRR/MAP), highlighting the discrepancy between offline metrics and user perception.","The primary outcome is a novel, user-centric educational recommender system that demonstrates the practical benefits of using scrutable Personal Knowledge Graphs. The study also provides a set of validated findings on the importance of user control in personalized learning environments.","The authors acknowledge several limitations: (1) The concept extraction process was sometimes imprecise, leading to irrelevant concepts being included in the PKG.

This directly addresses the HDM project's core challenge of integrating heterogeneous personal health data. The methodology, which covers ontology development, RDF mapping, and graph database implementation (GraphDB), offers a practical and validated blueprint for the HDM's data ingestion and representation layer. The paper's focus on using the KG to enable more efficient and accurate data analysis for patient outcomes is a primary goal of the HDM.","The key insight is that a knowledge graph-based approach provides a more efficient and intuitive way to analyze complex, heterogeneous EHR data compared to traditional relational databases. By creating a semantic layer (ontology) and representing the data as a graph, it becomes possible to easily query complex relationships and visualize connections that are difficult to see in a tabular format, ultimately enabling more comprehensive and holistic data analysis for better clinical decision-making.","The paper demonstrates how to build a knowledge graph from a large EHR dataset (MIMIC-III) to capture complex patient data relationships, enabling faster and more accurate analysis than traditional databases.","This study presents a methodology for constructing a knowledge graph from the MIMIC-III EHR dataset. The authors first develop an OWL ontology using Protégé to define the entities and relationships within the data. They then use Ontotext Refine to map the raw CSV data into RDF triples based on this ontology. The resulting knowledge graph is loaded into GraphDB, where SPARQL is used for querying and analysis. The authors demonstrate through sample queries that this approach can effectively capture semantic relationships, enabling more efficient and accurate analysis of patient data to identify trends and risk factors. They also show that their graph-based approach outperforms a traditional MySQL database in query execution time for similar tasks.",Can a knowledge graph created using the MIMIC III dataset and GraphDB effectively capture semantic relationships within EHRs and enable more efficient and accurate data analysis?,"The methodology involves a four-step process: 1. **Ontology Development**: An OWL ontology was created using Protégé to define the classes (e.g., Patient, Admission, Diagnosis) and properties of the EHR domain. 2. **Data Processing & RDF Mapping**: The MIMIC-III dataset (in CSV format) was processed using Ontotext Refine to map the data to the created ontology, generating RDF triples. 3. **Graph Representation**: The RDF triples were loaded into GraphDB to construct the knowledge graph. 4. **Querying and Analysis**: SPARQL queries were used to retrieve and analyze information from the graph, with use cases focused on identifying patient cohorts and risk factors. The performance was compared to a traditional MySQL database setup.","Knowledge graphs can effectively capture and represent the complex semantic relationships within large, heterogeneous EHR datasets. The graph-based approach allows for more efficient and intuitive data analysis compared to traditional relational databases. SPARQL queries on the GraphDB implementation were significantly faster (e.g., 0.11s vs. 1.33s for a sample query) than equivalent SQL queries on MySQL. The visual nature of the graph also enhances data exploration.","The primary outcome is a practical, implemented framework for converting a complex EHR dataset (MIMIC-III) into a queryable knowledge graph. This includes the developed ontology, the RDF mapping process, and a demonstration of its analytical capabilities through SPARQL queries.",The study acknowledges several limitations: the query performance evaluation was preliminary and used a limited set of sample queries. The ontology's clinical validity was not rigorously evaluated by external experts. The interoperability of the created KG with external standard vocabularies like SNOMED CT and LOINC was identified as a next step and not yet implemented.

While it deals with ""temporal processing,"" it does so at a neurophysiological level (millisecond-scale auditory perception in mice), which is not applicable to the HDM project's focus on temporal knowledge graphs, heterogeneous data integration, or system architecture.","The key insight is that the brain's ability to process rapid sounds may rely on two distinct channels: one for detecting sound onsets and another for sound offsets. Deficits in temporal hearing, such as difficulty detecting brief gaps in noise, could stem from a specific failure in the offset-detection channel rather than a general 'sluggishness' of the auditory system.","The paper shows that difficulty in hearing brief gaps in noise can be caused by a specific problem in the brain's ability to process the *end* of a sound, not the beginning, suggesting separate brain circuits for 'on' and 'off' sound detection.","This study uses a mouse model with auditory processing deficits to investigate the neural basis of gap-in-noise detection. Through extracellular recordings in the auditory thalamus, the researchers found that these mice have a specific deficit in neural sensitivity to brief gaps, which is linked to reduced neural responses to sound offsets, while responses to sound onsets and other rapidly changing sounds remain normal. They propose a model with two separate channels—one for sound onsets and one for offsets—and show that weakening the offset channel in the model replicates their experimental findings. This suggests that gap-detection deficits can arise from a specific impairment of the sound-offset-sensitive channel, revealing a dissociation in how the brain processes the beginning and end of sounds.","What is the neural mechanism underlying deficits in auditory temporal processing, specifically the detection of brief gaps in noise?","The study used a mouse model of gap-detection deficits (ectopic BXSB/MpJ-Yaa mice). They performed in-vivo extracellular recordings from three subdivisions of the auditory thalamus in anesthetized mice. They presented various auditory stimuli, including gap-in-noise stimuli and click trains, and developed a phenomenological model to test their hypothesis about dissociable onset and offset channels.","The study found that: (1) Ectopic mice have a deficit in thalamic sensitivity to brief gaps in noise, specific to certain auditory pathways. (2) This deficit is not due to a general loss of temporal acuity, as responses to other rapid stimuli are normal. (3) The deficit is specifically linked to reduced neural activity following sound *offsets*, not onsets. (4) In control mice, offset-responsive neurons are exceptionally sensitive to brief gaps, and this sensitivity is lost in ectopic mice.",The primary outcome is the experimental evidence and a supporting computational model demonstrating the existence of two dissociable mechanisms for auditory temporal processing (onset-sensitive and offset-sensitive). It shows that deficits in gap detection can arise specifically from impairment of the offset-sensitive channel.,"The study was conducted on anesthetized mice, which might affect neural responses. The model is phenomenological and not a detailed, physiologically realistic model of the auditory pathway. The link between the cortical ectopias and the thalamic deficit is correlational, and the causal mechanism remains unclear.","The brain has separate mechanisms for processing the start and end of sounds. Deficits in auditory temporal acuity, like the inability to detect brief gaps in noise, can be caused by a specific problem with the brain's 'sound-off' detectors, rather than a general slowdown in auditory processing.","The paper points to the need to understand the precise origin of the offset-response deficit (e.g., brainstem, thalamus, or cortical feedback).

Soares, Raphael M. Thiago, Julio Cesar Cardoso Tesolin, Anna C. Oliveira, Marcio Ferreira Moreno",2023,Yes,SUPER,"This paper is of super relevancy as it proposes a complete polystore architecture, HKPoly, designed to query heterogeneous data stores through a unified Knowledge Graph-based global schema. This directly addresses the HDM project's core challenge of integrating disparate personal data sources. The architecture's use of provenance to create explicit links between data fragments and its focus on reducing query complexity for the end-user provide a strong theoretical and practical foundation for the HDM system design, particularly for the upstream data processing and integration layer.","The key insight is the use of a Knowledge Graph not just as a data model, but as a comprehensive meta-layer that stores the global schema, local schemas, mappings, and provenance data. This allows the system to dynamically generate queries to underlying heterogeneous sources (via something like PostgreSQL FDWs) while presenting a simple, unified view to the user, effectively abstracting away the complexity of data location, format, and linkage.","The paper presents HKPoly, a polystore architecture that uses a Knowledge Graph to create a unified query layer over different types of databases (SQL, NoSQL, etc.). It uses provenance data to automatically link related information across these databases, making it much simpler for users to query complex, fragmented data.","This paper tackles the challenge of querying heterogeneous data residing in different, unlinked data stores. The authors propose a federated database architecture, HKPoly, which provides a single global conceptual schema to users. This schema, represented as a Knowledge Graph, encapsulates data heterogeneity, location, and linkage. The system uses meta-models for the global and local schemas, mappings between them, and captures provenance data from workflows to create explicit links between data. The architecture was implemented as a polystore service and evaluated in an Oil & Gas industry scenario, showing it could reduce query complexity by half with a manageable performance overhead (under 30%).",How to query data that are not explicitly connected residing on heterogeneous data stores?,"The authors propose a polystore architecture (HKPoly) based on the Mediator/Wrapper MDBS pattern. They use a Knowledge Graph (implemented with Hyperknowledge) to store a global conceptual schema, local schemas for each data source, and mappings between them. Data linkage is achieved by capturing workflow provenance using ProvLake. The architecture is implemented as a RESTful service and evaluated by comparing its query complexity (for the user) and query performance (for the database) against a standard PostgreSQL Foreign Data Wrapper (FDW) setup in a simulated Oil & Gas use case.","The proposed architecture allows for writing queries that are more than two times less complex for the user compared to a standard relational multidatabase system (PostgreSQL FDW). The trade-off is a performance overhead in query processing time that does not exceed 30%, which the authors deem acceptable.","The primary outcome is the HKPoly architecture itself, a viable polystore system that successfully uses a Knowledge Graph and provenance to provide a unified, simplified query interface over heterogeneous data stores.","The query processing time, while deemed acceptable, still has an overhead of up to 30% compared to a direct FDW implementation, indicating a need for further optimization. The complexity of setting up the GCS, LCS, and mappings relies on a Knowledge Engineer, which could be a bottleneck.","The paper concludes that the proposed polystore architecture, HKPoly, is a valid and useful approach for querying heterogeneous data stores. By using a Knowledge Graph for schema and provenance management, it significantly reduces the cognitive load on users writing queries, making integrated data access more feasible, with an acceptable performance trade-off.",The paper highlights the need for further research into query optimization for such polystore systems to reduce the performance overhead. Automating the creation of schemas and mappings is another area for future work.,"Future work includes improving query processing performance, further investigation into query optimization techniques, and potentially automating parts of the schema and mapping creation process.","A key insight is the practical use of PostgreSQL Foreign Data Wrappers (FDW) as the ""last mile"" connector to the underlying data stores.

The metrics for data quality and relevance could be loosely inspiring but are not directly applicable to the core problems of the HDM project.","The key insight is that data selection for pretraining matters significantly. It's not just about the quantity of data, but also its quality (similarity between image and text) and relevance to downstream tasks. The paper shows that by creating metrics for these aspects, one can intelligently subsample large datasets to improve model performance, which is more efficient than simply using more data.","The paper proposes metrics to measure the quality and relevance of visuolinguistic data and shows that pretraining on a smaller, curated dataset selected using these metrics can outperform pretraining on larger, unfiltered datasets.","This paper investigates the impact of data quality and relevance on the performance of self-supervised pretraining for visuolinguistic models.

Pretraining on a smaller ""amalgam"" dataset curated for high quality and relevance outperformed pretraining on larger, uncurated datasets. The study also found that data quality (image-text grounding) was a more important factor than data relevance.","The primary outcomes are the two proposed metrics for data quality and relevance, and the empirical demonstration that data curation based on these metrics is an effective strategy for improving the efficiency and performance of pretraining for visuolinguistic models.","The analysis is computationally expensive, making it hard to test many different metrics. The downstream tasks are broad, making it difficult to fully disentangle the effects of quality and relevance. The proposed metrics don't capture all the variance in performance, as shown by the Ngram Image Search dataset which performed better than its scores would suggest.","The paper concludes that simple, inexpensive metrics for data quality and relevance can be used to effectively filter large pretraining datasets, leading to better performance on downstream tasks. This suggests that data curation is a crucial and often overlooked aspect of the pretraining pipeline.","The paper points to the need for faster methods to evaluate data selection strategies. It also suggests that analyzing more niche downstream tasks could help to better disentangle the effects of quality and relevance. Finally, it notes that the proposed metrics are not perfect and that there is room for developing more sophisticated metrics.","The authors plan to apply their metrics to other domains, such as filtering large-scale video and ASR data, where the amount of available data is too large to be used entirely for pretraining.","The use of TF-IDF for relevance and GloVe vector similarity for quality are practical, easy-to-implement techniques for data scoring.

berlin_2014,Benchmarking Scalability and Elasticity of Distributed Database Systems,"Jorn Kuhlenkamp, Markus Klems, Oliver Ross",2014,Yes,MEDIUM,"This paper is of medium relevancy. It provides a detailed performance, scalability, and elasticity benchmark of distributed database systems (HBase and Cassandra). While not directly about knowledge graphs or heterogeneous data integration in the semantic sense, the HDM project will require a scalable and elastic persistence layer. This paper's methodology for benchmarking these non-functional requirements is highly relevant for evaluating potential database technologies for the HDM system.","The key insight is the clear trade-off between scaling speed and performance stability in distributed databases. The paper demonstrates that while systems can be scaled quickly (e.g., by adding nodes without waiting for data re-distribution), this often comes at the cost of increased performance variability and potential data inconsistency. This highlights the need for careful consideration of scaling strategies based on the specific workload and availability requirements.","This paper reproduces and extends previous performance and scalability benchmarks for the distributed database systems HBase and Cassandra. It verifies that both systems scale nearly linearly but with different performance characteristics (Cassandra being better for reads, HBase for writes). The authors extend the original work by evaluating elasticity, measuring the trade-off between scaling speed and the performance impact on concurrent workloads.",The paper aims to reproduce previous performance and scalability benchmarks of HBase and Cassandra and extend them with an evaluation of elasticity.,"The authors reproduce experiments from prior research [14] using the YCSB benchmark on Amazon EC2 infrastructure. They compare the performance of HBase and Cassandra on various workloads (read-heavy, write-heavy, scan-heavy) and cluster sizes. They then extend these experiments to measure elasticity by observing the performance impact of adding or removing nodes during a running workload, testing different scaling strategies (e.g., varying data streaming throughput).","The reproduced experiments confirm that both Cassandra and HBase scale nearly linearly, and that Cassandra generally has better read performance while HBase has better write performance. The new elasticity experiments quantify the trade-off between scaling speed and performance stability, showing that faster scaling often leads to higher performance variability during the scaling operation.",The primary outcome is a verified and extended set of benchmarks for HBase and Cassandra that not only cover performance and scalability but also elasticity. This provides a more complete picture for decision-makers choosing a distributed database.,"The experiments were conducted on a specific version of the software and on a specific cloud infrastructure (Amazon EC2), which may not perfectly generalize to other environments. The workloads are synthetic (YCSB) and may not fully represent all real-world application behaviors.","The paper concludes that while general performance characteristics of distributed databases can be verified across different environments, absolute performance numbers are highly dependent on the underlying infrastructure. It also highlights that elasticity is a critical but often overlooked aspect of distributed systems, and that there is a clear trade-off between how fast a system can scale and how stable its performance remains during the scaling process.",The paper implicitly points to the need for more standardized and comprehensive benchmarking methodologies that include elasticity as a first-class citizen. It also highlights the challenge of reproducing benchmark results across different infrastructure environments.,Future work could involve developing more sophisticated elasticity benchmarks that cover a wider range of scaling scenarios and failure conditions.,"The paper provides a practical methodology for benchmarking the scalability and elasticity of distributed databases, which is a valuable process for the HDM project to adopt when selecting its own database technology. The detailed analysis of different EC2 instance types and storage configurations provides a good example of the factors to consider when deploying a database in the cloud.

brennan_2016,Towards a knowledge driven framework for bridging the gap between software and data engineering,"Monika Solanki, Bojan Božic´, Christian Dirschl, Rob Brennan",2016,Yes,HIGH,"This paper is highly relevant. The HDM project is a data-intensive software system, and this paper's proposal of a suite of ontologies (the ALIGNED suite) to bridge the gap between software and data engineering provides a powerful architectural pattern. The concepts of a Design Intent Ontology (DIO), Software Lifecycle Ontology (SLO), and Data Lifecycle Ontology (DLO) offer a robust, high-level framework for managing the development and maintenance of a system that handles heterogeneous personal data. The emphasis on provenance (using W3C PROV) is also a critical requirement for the HDM.","The key insight is that software engineering and data engineering, while often treated as separate disciplines, can and should be integrated using a common semantic layer. An ontology-based framework can provide this layer, enabling better tool-chain integration, unified governance, and clearer communication across teams and processes.","This paper presents the ALIGNED suite of ontologies, a framework designed to bridge the gap between software and data engineering for large-scale, data-intensive systems. The suite provides semantic models for design intents, software and data lifecycles, and data quality. The authors demonstrate its application in two complex use cases (a legal information system and a historical databank), showing how the ontologies can facilitate tool integration and unified governance.","How can a knowledge-driven framework, based on a suite of ontologies, be used to bridge the gap between software engineering and data engineering processes for data-intensive systems?","The authors developed the ALIGNED suite of ontologies based on a thorough requirements analysis from real-world use cases. The methodology involved: (1) identifying generic and use-case-specific requirements, (2) designing a modular suite of ontologies (reusing existing standards like PROV-O where possible), (3) deploying and validating the ontologies in two large-scale projects (JURION and Seshat), and (4) evaluating the ontologies against established design principles (e.g., Gruber's principles).","The ALIGNED ontology suite provides an effective framework for integrating software and data engineering processes. The use of these ontologies enables better tool-chain integration, unified governance, and the creation of a common semantic understanding across different parts of a data-intensive system. The user-driven evaluation showed a 50% increase in efficiency for certain tasks.","The primary outcome is the ALIGNED suite of ontologies itself, a publicly available and well-documented resource for building data-intensive systems. The paper also provides a set of requirements and design patterns for this domain.","The paper acknowledges that the development of such ontologies still requires significant manual effort from domain experts. The evaluation, while positive, is based on specific use cases and tools within the ALIGNED project.","The paper concludes that a knowledge-driven framework based on ontologies is a powerful approach for aligning software and data engineering. This alignment is crucial for increasing the productivity, agility, and quality of data-intensive systems.",The paper implicitly points to the need for more automated tools for ontology engineering and for mapping between different domain-specific models.,Future work includes the empirical evaluation of the ontologies in a wider range of use cases and the development of more advanced tools that leverage the ALIGNED framework.,"The modular architecture of the ALIGNED suite (provenance, generic, domain-specific layers) is a key implementation pattern. The use of W3C PROV as a foundational layer for all models is a best practice for ensuring data lineage. The paper also provides concrete examples of how to use the ontologies to create audit trails and integrate different tools (like JIRA and Confluence).",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2018.12.017,10.1016/j.jss.2018.12.017,"Ontology, Software Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Integration, Knowledge-Driven Framework, Semantic Web, Provenance, Data Lifecycle, Software Lifecycle","knowledge-graph, data-integration"
briggs_2021,A Review of Privacy-preserving Federated Learning for the Internet-of-Things,"Christopher Briggs, Zhong Fan, Peter Andras",2021,Yes,HIGH,"This paper is highly relevant as it provides a comprehensive survey of privacy-preserving federated learning, a key architectural consideration for the HDM project. Given that the HDM will manage sensitive personal data in a distributed manner, understanding the privacy risks, attack vectors, and defense mechanisms (like differential privacy and secure aggregation) discussed in this paper is crucial for designing a robust and trustworthy system.","The key insight is that federated learning is not inherently private. While it prevents direct data sharing, the model updates themselves can leak sensitive information. Therefore, additional privacy-enhancing technologies are essential. The paper provides a clear overview of the trade-offs between privacy, model utility, and communication efficiency, which is a critical consideration for any practical implementation.","This paper provides a comprehensive review of federated learning as a privacy-preserving machine learning approach for distributed data, with a particular focus on its application in the Internet-of-Things (IoT). It surveys a wide range of methods for improving communication efficiency, handling client heterogeneity, and preserving privacy, identifying the strengths and weaknesses of each.","What are the state-of-the-art privacy-preserving methods for federated learning, and what are the key challenges and future directions for their application in the IoT?","The authors conduct a systematic literature review, surveying a wide variety of papers on federated learning. They categorize the research into three main areas: communication efficiency, client heterogeneity, and privacy-preserving methods. The paper provides a historical context by discussing distributed machine learning and then delves into the specifics of federated learning and its associated privacy challenges.","The paper finds that while federated learning offers a good starting point for privacy, it is vulnerable to various attacks. It identifies a range of privacy-preserving techniques, including anonymization, encryption (homomorphic and SMC), and differential privacy, and discusses their applicability to federated learning. It also highlights the importance of communication-efficient methods (like model compression) for the resource-constrained IoT environment.","The primary outcome is a comprehensive survey that serves as a valuable guide to the field of privacy-preserving federated learning. It provides a clear taxonomy of the challenges and solutions, and outlines a roadmap for future research.","As a survey, the paper synthesizes existing work and does not propose new methods. The field of federated learning is evolving rapidly, so some of the discussed techniques may have been superseded by newer approaches.","The paper concludes that federated learning, when combined with robust privacy-preserving mechanisms, is a powerful paradigm for machine learning on distributed, sensitive data. However, there is no one-size-fits-all solution, and the choice of methods depends on the specific application's requirements regarding privacy, utility, and efficiency.","The paper identifies several research gaps, including the need for better methods for hyperparameter tuning in a federated setting, more research into continual learning on distributed data, and the development of more efficient and robust privacy-preserving techniques.","Future work should focus on developing more advanced and computationally efficient privacy-preserving methods, exploring the combination of federated learning with fog computing, and designing federated learning algorithms specifically for low-power IoT devices.",The paper provides a good overview of practical privacy-preserving techniques that can be implemented in a federated system. This includes the use of Secure Multi-party Computation (SMC) for secure aggregation of model updates and the application of differential privacy (both global and local) to add noise to the updates and protect individual contributions. The discussion of communication-efficient techniques like model quantization and sparsification is also highly relevant for practical deployment.,,,"Federated Learning, Privacy, IoT, Survey, Differential Privacy, Secure Aggregation, Machine Learning","knowledge-graph, data-integration, educational-technology"

This is directly applicable to the HDM project, especially its healthcare-related aspects. The focus on data heterogeneity, integration challenges, and the need for validation aligns perfectly with the HDM's research focus.","The key insight is the systematic identification of a gap between the potential of KGs in healthcare and their actual clinical translation. The paper highlights that while there's a lot of research, there's a lack of real-world validation and standardized practices. The delineation of KGs into ""biomedical"" and ""clinical"" clusters is also a significant insight.","This paper conducts a scoping review of 255 articles to characterize the use of knowledge graphs in biomedical and healthcare sciences. It finds that while medical science insights and drug repurposing are common applications, there is a wide variety of use cases. The review highlights the heterogeneity of KGs in terms of size and data sources, with DrugBank being the most common. It also notes that while advanced machine learning techniques are used, simple querying remains a prevalent analysis method. A key finding is the lack of real-world validation for insights derived from these KGs, posing a major challenge for their clinical translation.","What are the use cases, data characteristics, and research attributes of knowledge graphs in the biomedical and healthcare sciences, and to what extent are the findings from these KGs validated in the real world?","The authors conducted a scoping review following the PRISMA-ScR checklist. They performed keyword-based searches on multiple databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, medRxiv, arXiv, bioRxiv) and screened 255 articles for inclusion. Data was extracted on demographics, graph characteristics, data sources, analysis techniques, and validation methods.","The most common use cases for KGs are medical science insights and drug repurposing. KGs are heterogeneous in size and data sources. DrugBank is the most used data source. A meta-analysis of node classes suggests a split between ""biomedical"" and ""clinical"" graphs. While advanced ML is used, simple querying is the most common analysis technique. A major finding is that most studies rely on ""inside graph"" validation, with very few performing ""outside graph"" validation (e.g., clinical trials).","A comprehensive scoping review that systematically describes the landscape of KG applications in biomedicine and healthcare. It provides a categorization of use cases, an analysis of graph characteristics, and a critical assessment of validation practices in the field.",The review has a cut-off date of November 2021. The search strategy might have missed some relevant papers. The review is limited to academic literature and does not include commercial or patent data. The categorization of use cases was developed by the authors and is exploratory.,"KGs have many possible uses in biomedicine and healthcare, but their full potential is yet to be realised. The two most popular use cases to date are generation of medical science insights and drug repurposing. There is an opportunity to expand work areas across other use cases and across diseases. Heterogeneity in graph size and context specificity suggests further work is needed to understand optimum graph construction. There are many different techniques used in graph analysis - deploying more sophisticated graph machine learning techniques may improve insights gained from KGs. Validation of findings from graphs through external testing will increase the robustness of conclusions drawn from graphs.","The paper identifies several gaps: the need for best practices in KG construction (especially regarding size and connectivity), better integration of -omics and patient data, understanding how to integrate KGs with LLMs, and the need for more open-sourcing of graphs and data. The most significant gap is the lack of ""outside graph"" validation.","Future research should focus on establishing best practices for KG construction and analysis, improving the integration of diverse data types, exploring the synergy between KGs and LLMs, and, most importantly, conducting more real-world validation of KG-derived insights.","The paper highlights the challenges of integrating clinical data (EHRs) due to lack of standardization, noise, and privacy concerns. This is a crucial consideration for the HDM project. The clear distinction between ""biomedical"" and ""clinical"" KGs is a useful conceptual model.

Understanding the state-of-the-art, challenges, and future directions in TKGC is crucial for designing the HDM's knowledge representation and reasoning capabilities.","The key insight is the systematic categorization of TKGC methods, which provides a clear map of the research landscape. It highlights that the central challenge in TKGC is how to effectively integrate temporal validity into models to capture the dynamics of entities and relations.","A comprehensive survey of methods for predicting missing links in knowledge graphs that change over time, categorizing approaches and outlining future challenges.","This paper provides a comprehensive survey of recent advances in Temporal Knowledge Graph Completion (TKGC). It details the background, benchmark datasets, and evaluation metrics for TKGC.

They detail the background of TKGC, including preliminaries, benchmark datasets (ICEWS, GDELT, YAGO15k, WIKIDATA), and evaluation metrics (Hits@k, MR, MRR). They then propose a taxonomy to categorize existing TKGC methods.","The paper finds that TKGC methods significantly improve link prediction by incorporating temporal information. It identifies six main categories of approaches for integrating time: time-included tensor decomposition, time-based transformation, dynamic embedding, learning from KG snapshots, reasoning with historical context, and temporal logical rules.","The primary outcome is a comprehensive survey that, for the first time, systematically summarizes and categorizes the research in Temporal Knowledge Graph Completion.","As a survey, it does not present new methods or experimental results. The authors explicitly state they do not compare the published performance of existing methods due to implementation differences. The field is rapidly evolving, so new methods may have emerged since its publication.","TKGC is a crucial and rapidly growing research area. While significant progress has been made, there are still open challenges, particularly in incorporating external knowledge, developing better negative sampling techniques, scaling to larger graphs, and handling evolving knowledge graphs in a continual learning setting.","The paper identifies several gaps: the need to incorporate external knowledge (like entity types and semantics from LLMs), the need for more sophisticated time-aware negative sampling techniques, the challenge of scaling TKGC methods to real-life, billion-fact KGs, and the need for incremental/continual learning approaches for evolving KGs.","Future research should focus on addressing the identified gaps, including developing methods for incorporating external knowledge, creating better negative sampling strategies, designing distributed and compositional models for scalability, and investigating continual learning techniques for dynamic KGs.","The paper provides a valuable overview of different architectural patterns for TKGC. The categorization itself is an implementation insight, guiding the choice of approach based on the problem. For example, tensor decomposition methods are lightweight, while snapshot-based methods using GCNs can capture complex structural dependencies.

cai_2023,Temporal Knowledge Graph Completion with Time-sensitive Relations in Hypercomplex Space,"Li Cai, Xin Mao, Zhihong Wang, Shangqing Zhao, Yuhao Zhou, Changxu Wu, Man Lan",2023,Yes,HIGH,This paper is highly relevant as it proposes a novel and more expressive method for temporal knowledge graph completion (TKGC) using quaternion representations in hypercomplex space. This directly addresses the HDM project's need for advanced temporal modeling capabilities. The focus on capturing time-sensitive relations through rotation and periodic translation offers a sophisticated technique for handling the complex temporal dynamics of personal data.,"The key insight is that modeling time-sensitive relations, rather than just time-aware entities, provides a more powerful way to capture temporal dynamics in a TKG. The use of quaternions for time-aware rotation and periodic time translation allows the model to capture complex temporal variability more effectively than methods operating in real or complex spaces.","This paper introduces a novel method for temporal knowledge graph completion (TKGC) that uses quaternion representations in hypercomplex space to model time-sensitive relations. The proposed approach, TQuatE, employs time-aware rotation and periodic time translation to capture complex temporal patterns and is theoretically shown to model a wide range of relational patterns.",How can we improve the performance of temporal knowledge graph completion by better capturing the complex temporal variability of facts?,"The authors propose TQuatE, a TKGC model that uses quaternion embeddings for entities, relations, and time. It models time-sensitive relations through a combination of time-aware rotation (using the Hamilton product) and periodic time translation (using a sine function on a periodic time embedding). The model is evaluated on three public datasets (ICEWS14, ICEWS05-15, GDELT) and compared against a range of static and temporal baseline methods.","The proposed TQuatE model achieves state-of-the-art performance on all three benchmark datasets, significantly outperforming existing methods, especially on the GDELT dataset which is known for its complex temporal variability. For example, it improves MRR over the previous state-of-the-art by up to 8.38% on GDELT.","The primary outcome is the TQuatE model, a novel and high-performing approach for TKGC. The paper also provides theoretical proofs that the model can capture symmetric, asymmetric, inverse, compositional, and evolutionary relation patterns.","The paper notes that the quaternion multiplication is more computationally expensive than complex multiplication, leading to longer training times compared to some baselines, even though the performance improvement on some datasets is marginal.","The paper concludes that leveraging the expressive power of hypercomplex space, specifically quaternions, to model time-sensitive relations is an effective strategy for improving the performance of temporal knowledge graph completion.","The paper highlights the need for more efficient methods for TKGC, as the complexity of quaternion operations can be a bottleneck.

clark_2001,Knowledge Patterns,"Peter Clark, John Thompson, Bruce Porter, Knowledge Systems, Texas Austin",2001,Yes,HIGH,"This paper is highly relevant to the HDM project because it addresses the fundamental challenge of knowledge representation and reuse in complex systems. The concept of ""knowledge patterns"" provides a powerful framework for modularizing and structuring the knowledge base of an HDM system, which needs to integrate heterogeneous data from diverse personal and external sources. The paper's emphasis on making modeling decisions explicit is crucial for building a transparent and maintainable HDM. The techniques described can be directly applied to develop a library of reusable knowledge patterns for common personal data types (e.g., calendars, contacts, health data), facilitating the construction of a robust and scalable PKG.","The paper introduces ""knowledge patterns,"" a technique for constructing axiom-rich formal ontologies by explicitly representing recurring patterns of knowledge and mapping them to domain-specific concepts. This approach modularizes ontologies, making modeling decisions clear and facilitating knowledge reuse.","This paper presents ""knowledge patterns,"" a novel technique for building formal ontologies. Instead of writing axioms from scratch, this method identifies and reuses recurring patterns of knowledge. By separating abstract theories from their specific applications, it provides a more modular, flexible, and explicit way to construct complex knowledge bases, overcoming the limitations of traditional inheritance-based approaches.","How can we better structure and modularize formal, axiom-rich ontologies to make modeling decisions explicit and facilitate the reuse of recurring knowledge patterns?","The paper proposes the ""knowledge patterns"" technique, which involves: 1. Identifying and representing recurring theory schemata as explicit, self-contained patterns. 2. Defining morphisms (mappings) for each application of a pattern to a target knowledge base. 3. Importing morphed copies of the pattern into the knowledge base. The authors illustrate this with examples from a knowledge-based system for astronaut training (KB-PHaSE).","Knowledge patterns provide a more flexible and explicit way to reuse knowledge compared to traditional inheritance. They allow for the application of abstract theories in multiple, distinct ways to the same domain concept and support partial application of a theory. This leads to better modularization and clearer representation of modeling decisions in formal ontologies.","The primary outcome is the ""knowledge patterns"" technique itself, a new method for ontological engineering. The paper also presents the KB-PHaSE system as a practical application and proof-of-concept for this technique.","The authors acknowledge several limitations: the approach does not support run-time modeling decisions, it doesn't address how to find relevant patterns or their boundaries, and it leaves the task of finding appropriate mappings to the knowledge engineer.","Knowledge patterns are a significant technique for modularizing axioms in formal ontologies, isolating general theories for reuse, and making modeling decisions explicit. This approach can foster the development of reusable theory libraries, which are essential for building large-scale formal ontologies and knowledge-based systems.","The paper points to the need for methods to automatically discover relevant knowledge patterns and their mappings, which is a focus of research in analogical reasoning. It also suggests that further work is needed to explore run-time application of these patterns.","Future work could explore the automatic discovery of knowledge patterns and their mappings, potentially drawing from research in analogical reasoning. They also mention the possibility of developing a run-time version of the pattern application mechanism.","The paper provides insights into implementing knowledge patterns, including the use of morphisms for mapping and the handling of symbols that don't have counterparts in the target knowledge base.

Three use cases demonstrate practical applications across different domains.","The XI Pipeline successfully integrates heterogeneous data across multiple domains, with human involvement improving entity linking results by over 10%. The framework enables complex query capabilities (e.g., 'find all politicians dying in Switzerland') and practical applications including job auditing, SLO extraction, and global job ranking. Key findings emphasize the crucial role of fine-grained entity types and the necessity of domain-specific customization for effective data integration.","The primary outcome is the XI Pipeline framework itself, a systematic 5-step methodology for Knowledge Graph-based data integration. The paper also delivers three practical systems (ScienceWise, ArmaTweet, Guider) demonstrating real-world applicability, along with architectural insights about the importance of fine-grained typing, human validation, and domain specialization in heterogeneous data integration projects.","The approach requires significant manual effort and domain expertise for customization. Automated techniques alone cannot fully capture semantic complexity of arbitrary input data. The integration quality is constrained by the underlying Knowledge Graph quality, including errors, inconsistencies, and missing data. Generic platforms proved impractical, requiring specialized approaches for each use case and data modality.","Knowledge Graphs provide powerful and flexible abstractions for heterogeneous data integration, but success requires systematic approaches, human validation, fine-grained entity typing, and domain-specific customization. The XI Pipeline demonstrates that effective integration is achievable through modular, multi-step processing combined with careful attention to data quality and semantic precision.",The paper identifies the need for composable software libraries focused on specific integration subprocesses and data modalities. It highlights challenges in scaling automated semantic understanding and the ongoing requirement for human expertise in complex integration scenarios. The quality dependency on underlying Knowledge Graph completeness and accuracy remains a significant limitation.,"Future work should focus on developing libraries of composable software artifacts for different integration subprocesses and data modalities, improving automated semantic understanding capabilities, and addressing Knowledge Graph quality issues including error correction and completeness enhancement.","The paper provides concrete implementation insights including the use of probabilistic graphs for entity disambiguation, microtask crowdsourcing for quality improvement, fine-grained type hierarchies for downstream task optimization, distant supervision for relation extraction, and neural architectures (Aggregated Piecewise CNN) for semantic relationship identification.

The authors present detailed taxonomies of privacy attacks (membership inference, property inference, model inversion, reconstruction) and defense mechanisms (differential privacy, cryptographic approaches, trusted execution environments), alongside comprehensive coverage of fairness definitions including both algorithmic fairness (demographic parity, equal opportunity) and client-level fairness unique to federated settings. The survey reveals complex bilateral interactions between privacy and fairness, demonstrating that privacy mechanisms disproportionately harm underrepresented groups while fairness requirements can increase privacy risks through overfitting and additional data collection needs. The authors systematically analyze 230+ references spanning privacy attacks, defense strategies, fairness-aware algorithms, and emerging solutions for simultaneous privacy-fairness optimization.

The authors categorize data into three classes: A-data requiring strong consistency (high penalty for inconsistency), C-data accepting weak consistency (low penalty), and B-data with adaptive requirements based on context. They develop several adaptive policies for B-data including General policy (conflict probability-based), Time policy (deadline-based), Fixed threshold policy (value-based), Demarcation policy (distributed shares), and Dynamic policy (statistical threshold adjustment). The system implements both session consistency and serializability protocols with automatic switching mechanisms.
