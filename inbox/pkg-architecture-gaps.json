In this paper, we envision personal research\nknowledge graphs (PRKGs) as a means to represent structured information about\nthe research activities of a researcher. PRKGs can be used to power intelligent\npersonal assistants, and personalize various applications. We explore what\nentities and relations could be potentially included in a PRKG, how to extract\nthem from various sources, and how to share a PRKG within a research group.\n  …"

Their applications in the software engineering of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) are also growing. However, research in this area remains limited. Moreover, existing studies have primarily focused on LLMs-only one type of FM-leaving ample opportunities to explore others, such  …",
