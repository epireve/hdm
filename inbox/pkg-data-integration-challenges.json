Introduction \n Contemporary biomedical research and medical practices are increasingly turning into data-intensive fields, for which computational intelligence approaches, such as those based on artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) methods are becoming the norm. Due to the specific nature of these fields, the integration and management of the ever-growing volumes of heterogeneous data involved, often presents a number of challenges. These challenges become even more relevant in the light of the importance that AI/ML are gaining, establishing themselves at the core of the state-of-t …",

Thus, in general, gathering information is challenging, and one of the main reasons is that data sources are designed to support specific applications. Very often their structure is unknown to the large part of users. Moreover, the stored data is often redundant, mixed with information only needed to support enterprise processes, and incompl …",
