### I. INTRODUCTION

In 2022, the Ministry of Education announced its latest work priorities, mentioning the implementation of the Education Digitalization Strategy Initiative, which is strengthening demand, deepening integration, applicationdriven and actively promoting "Internet+Education", accelerate the digitalization and intelligent transformation and upgrading of education [1]. As the beginning of vocational education, secondary vocational schools are responsible for basic education and teaching, and provide a solid foundation for the success and development of students. Therefore, it is crucial to explore new educational and teaching methods in secondary vocational schools. By adopting a rich supply of digital education resources and services, the foundation is laid for exploring smart classroom construction and improving classroom teaching models. At present, in order to improve the quality of teaching, enhance students' interest in learning and strengthen their abilities, it is important to diversify and enrich teaching and learning activities by integrating internet technologies into teaching and learning, using a variety of open source software and devices.

Although knowledge graph has been developed for several years, it is still at the initial stage of application in the field of education. In 2019, the "National Education Informatization Work Conference" pointed out that promoting the development of key technologies such as big data, deep learning, and knowledge graph is one of the main elements of basic science research in education [2]. This paper applies SmartKG to realize the construction and application of the knowledge graph for computer networking course group in secondary vocational schools. The approach we propose new ideas for the integration and innovation of information technology and educational teaching, as well as for the pedagogical development of computer courses.

As a fundamental course in computer science, Computer Network covers a wide range of knowledge and has a strong theoretical. It has a strong correlation with practical courses, such as Network Equipment Installation and Network Integrated Cabling. In the curriculum arrangement of secondary vocational school, these courses are arranged in different semesters, which result in the weak correlation ability of students to knowledge points and the inability to learn knowledge accurately and effectively. At the same time, due to the different basic levels of students, it is impossible to uniformly measure their mastery of knowledge. However, as a set of knowledge points, knowledge graph not only facilitates students' evocation and extension of knowledge points, but also enriches the classroom format and strengthens students' desire for learning.

### II. RELATED CONCEPTS AND TECHNOLOGIES

## *A. Knowledge Graph*

It has been more than ten years since the concept of the knowledge graph was introduced. Knowledge graph is a type of knowledge base known as semantic network, which is a knowledge base with a directed graph structure. Knowledge graph consists of vertices and edges, where each vertex corresponds to an entity and each edge corresponds to a relationship between entities [3].The Education Knowledge Graph is an ontology construction of knowledge about a subject, which is stored and presented as a graph and can provide learning recommendation paths [4].

During the development of the Knowledge Graph, numerous more mature projects have emerged. For example, Common Knowledge Repository: Cyc, WordNet and so on; Internet Knowledge Graph: Freebase, DBpedia, Schema, Wikidata and so on; Domestic Knowledge Graph: OpenKG, CN-DBpedia, open class Chinese Encyclopedia Knowledge Graph (zhishi.me) and so on [5].

At present, knowledge graphs are widely used in various industries. For example, the knowledge graph enhances urban management capabilities, which enables the mutual integration and sharing of data from all areas of production and life, and helps to improve the quality of urban management services and people's living standards. The public security knowledge graph, which enables the association of key people, time, place, events, objects and other entities, and helps to improve the efficiency of public security personnel.

## *B. Knowledge Graph Construction Process*

The construction of knowledge graph mainly adopts two methods of top-down and bottom-up [3]. The top-down method is used to construct the domain knowledge graphs, which takes the data within the domain or the enterprise as the main source and extract ontology and pattern information from high quality data to form knowledge graphs. This method requires high data quality and the resulting knowledge graphs are extremely accurate. The bottom-up method is mainly used to construct the general knowledge graphs, which extracts data from various public data sets on the Internet with the help of certain technical means to form knowledge graphs. This method generally contains a large number of things and a variety of common knowledge information.

The process of building a knowledge graph mainly consists of data collection, knowledge extraction, knowledge integration and knowledge application. The technical architecture of the knowledge graph is shown in Figure 1.

![](_page_1_Figure_4.jpeg)
<!-- Image Description: The flowchart illustrates a knowledge graph construction process. It shows data collection (structured, semi-structured, unstructured), knowledge extraction (physical, relationship, attribute extraction), knowledge integration (consolidation, common finger dissipation, entity disambiguation), and knowledge processing (intellectual reasoning, quality assessment, ontology construction). The output is a knowledge graph built from third-party databases. -->

Figure 1. The technical architecture of the knowledge graph

Knowledge acquisition refers to the adoption of various ways and methods to obtain the data, including structured data, non-structured data and semi-structured data, and ultimately to extract structured information such as entities, relationships and entity attributes from the acquired data [6]. The key techniques involved in knowledge acquisition mainly include entity extraction, relationship extraction, attribute extraction, etc.

Knowledge representation refers to the representation of knowledge and the relationships between knowledge in a way that humans can carry out to recognise and understand it. It can also be understood as the representation of various types of knowledge in the real world as a computer storable and computable structure [7]. Currently, knowledge representation method is mainly described in the form of RDF (Resource Description Framework) triples.

Through knowledge acquisition, the results obtained may contain a large amount of redundant data, while there is a flattening of data relationships between them, lacking hierarchy and logic. In order to solve the above problems, a knowledge integration approach has been adopted. The key technologies involved mainly include entity linking and knowledge fusion.

The results obtained through knowledge acquisition and knowledge integration are not equal to knowledge. To obtain a structured and networked knowledge system, it is necessary to go through the process of knowledge processing. The key technologies involved in knowledge processing mainly include ontology construction, knowledge reasoning and quality assessment [8].

The content contained in the knowledge graph needs to be constantly updated with the changes of the time. And there are two methods of updating it. The first method is a complete update, which means building a Knowledge Graph from scratch. This method is relatively simple, but requires a lot of resources. The second method is incremental updating, which means adding new knowledge based on the existing knowledge graph. This method is more complex, but consumes less resources [6].

### *C. SmartKG*

SmartKG is an open source knowledge graph building product developed by Microsoft. The product is mainly used in knowledge graph teaching systems and is a lightweight tool for verifying the ontology design of knowledge graphs. SmartKG helps users to quickly build and visualise knowledge graphs. At the same time, according to the userdefined knowledge graphs, the system will automatically generate CheckBot with the graph as the knowledge base for simple question and answer operations.

The user describes the knowledge graph by using the corresponding template provided by SmartKG, which is an Excel document. The document contains two tables, one is an entity table and the other is a relationship table. Each row corresponds to an entity or a relationship. The entity table contains the entity ID, entity name, entity label, lead word, attribute name and attribute value. The relationship table contains the relationship type, source entity ID, and target entity ID. The specific meaning is shown in Table 1.

TABLE I. SMARTKG TABLE PROPERTIES

| Name | connotation | | |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------|--|--|
| entity ID | ID number | | |
| entity name | Node Name | | |
| entity label | Node Type | | |
| lead word | Auxiliary as CheckBot | | |
| attribute name | Attribute name | | |
| attribute value | Instance of attribute name | | |
| relationship type | Relationship Name | | |
| source entity ID | ID of the header entity to be connected | | |
| target entity ID | Required The ID of the tail entity to be | | |
| | connected | | |

SmartKG has the following features: (a) Visualization: The whole process is including template filling, data uploading and data presentation can be operated intuitively. (b) High performance: The product has a built in high performance graph database engine that allows users to set up hundreds or even thousands of entity nodes and display the relationships that exist between them. (c) Easy to extend: Users can target the entities and their relationships to be added by making changes to the table data, and timely updates can be made to display new diagrams. (d) Intelligent: Users can search and query to find a node and its corresponding relationships after generating a knowledge graph using SmartKG tools. At the same time, the SmartKG tool generates a corresponding knowledge base based on the documents provided by the user, which can be used for question and answer operations.

## III. KNOWLEDGE GRAPH CONSTRUCTION FOR COMPUTER NETWORK COURSE CLUSTERS

In this paper, the bottom-up method is used for knowledge graph construction. Firstly, the data is acquired from data sources such as e-textbooks, Zhihu and w3cschool. Then, entity identification, relationship extraction and attribute extraction are performed on the acquired data. Finally, the processed structured data is collated and imported into SmartKG to complete visualisation and other tasks.

### *A. Data Acquisition*

Due to regional differences and teaching resources, secondary vocational schools choose different textbooks, but their teaching contents are generally the same. Therefore, this paper selects Jingdong Bookstore, w3cschool, Baidu Encyclopedia and Zhihu as the network data sources and crawls the data through python.

In Jingdong Bookstore, input "computer network" and select the keyword "secondary vocational school and technical materials" to get hundreds of related books. Each book contains information such as "Content Introduction", "Author Introduction", "Contents", "Foreword", and so on. This paper focuses on obtaining the "Contents" information. In w3cschool, by searching the keyword "Computer Network", and crawl the data from the two parts of the computer network basic knowledge summary and TCP / IP tutorial. In the blog park, input the keyword "Computer Network Knowledge" to crawl the data of the computer network basics summary.

In addition, this experiment manually processes the content of the theoretical course "Fundamentals of Computer Network Technology" and the practical course "Installation and Commissioning of Network Equipment" for the secondary vocational school information security majors, to prepare for the subsequent keyword extraction, relationship extraction and entity attribute.

### *B. Keyword Extraction*

A key step in building a knowledge graph is through keyword extraction of the acquired data. There are many algorithms for keyword extraction, and this paper mainly applies the LDA document topic generation model, the statistical-based TF-IDF algorithm, and the network graphbased TextRank algorithm for keyword extraction.

LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation), also known as the three-layer Bayesian probabilistic model, is to discover the subject information contained in documents through unsupervised learning. It consists of a three-layer structure of words, topics and documents. By using the co-occurrence relationship of words in the document to cluster the words, two probability distributions of "document topic" and "topic word" are obtained [9]. The relationships are shown in Figure 2.

![](_page_2_Figure_10.jpeg)
<!-- Image Description: The figure is a graphical model depicting a generative process. It shows a directed acyclic graph where nodes represent variables (e.g., Î¸, Ï†, Z<sub>m,n</sub>, W<sub>m,n</sub>) and edges denote dependencies. The model likely illustrates the relationships between latent variables (Î¸, Ï†) and observed variables (W<sub>m,n</sub>), possibly within a Bayesian framework. Subscripts *m* and *n* suggest multiple instances of Z and W, indicating a structured data representation. The shaded node, W, implies it's the observed data. The purpose is to visually represent the probabilistic model's structure and data generation process. -->

Figure 2. LDA model

TF-IDF is a statistical method that measures the importance of a word to a document. The keywords of the document are extracted by using the statistical information of the words in the document. Its advantages are simplicity, ease of implementation and generalisability. TF-IDF not only considers the frequency of occurrence of a word TF, but also considers the inverse frequency IDF that the word does not appear in other documents, which gives an excellent indication of the differentiation of feature words and is a widely used retrieval method in the field of information retrieval [10]. Its formula is as follows:

$$
tfidf_{i,j} = tf_{i,j} * idf_i
$$
\n<sup>(1)</sup>

The tf represents word frequency. If a word occurs a total of i times in the document and there are N words in the entire document, the value of tf is:

$$
tf = \frac{t}{N} \tag{2}
$$

The idf is the inverse document frequency. If the whole document has n articles and a word appears in k articles, the value of idf is:

$$
idf = \log \frac{n}{k} \tag{3}
$$

The TextRank algorithm is a text ranking algorithm based on network graphs. One aspect of the network graphbased algorithm that differs from the above algorithms is that both the topic-based and statistical analysis methods require an off-the-shelf corpus, whereas the TextRank algorithm can be used to extract keywords from a single document out of the context of a corpus [11]. Its core formula is as follows:

$$
WS(V_i) = (1 - d) + d * \sum_{V_i \in (V_i)} \frac{W_{ji}}{\sum_{V_{k \in out(V_i)}} W_{jk}}
$$
(4)

Through the above three algorithms, this paper extracts keywords from the crawled data in turn. At the same time, stop words were added to filter out irrelevant words during the experiment. The final ranking was done by keyword weight, and Table 2 shows the top 10 keywords for each algorithm.

| LDA_model | | Textrank | | TF-IDF | |
|------------|--------|-----------------|--------|------------|--------|
| Keywords | Weight | Keywords | Weight | Keywords | Weight |
| Protocol | 0.0351 | Network | 0.0351 | Practical | 0.1643 |

TABLE II. TOP 10 KEYWORDS

## *C. Relationship Extraction*

Relationship extraction connects entities to each other and it is the key step to form knowledge graph. Commonly used methods for relationship extraction include rule-based methods, supervised learning methods, semi-supervised learning methods and unsupervised learning methods. Due to the small size of this experimental dataset, a rule-based approach combined with manual assistance is used for relationship extraction in order to improve the accuracy of the results.

Most rule-based methods rely on manual work, with more accurate results and no need for training data. As far as possible in the dataset, various hidden relationships such as dependencies and inclusion relationships between entities are found. In this paper, partial rules are first defined, and then relationship extraction is performed based on these rules. Some of the rules are shown in Table 3.

TABLE III. RELATIONSHIP EXTRACTION RULES

| Rules | Contents |
|--------|------------------------------|
| Rule 1 | X contains/is covered by Y |
| Rule 2 | X relates to/is related to Y |
| Rule3 | X is divided into Y |
| | |

Based on the above table, the relationships between entities (X,contains,Y), (X,associated,Y) and other relationships can be extracted when the relevant content is matched. Finally, a total of 521 relationships were extracted in this paper.

### *D. Knowledge Storage*

Through data crawling, keyword extraction and relationship extraction and other related work, our last step is to store and visualize knowledge. After comparing and measuring the extracted keywords with those obtained by manual construction, 239 entities were finally selected. At the same time, the attributes contained in each entity are completed manually. This paper uses SmartKG for knowledge storage and the results are shown in Figure 3.

![](_page_3_Figure_12.jpeg)
<!-- Image Description: This image displays a knowledge graph, a network visualization. Nodes (circles), colored by category, represent concepts (e.g., "content," "subtask"). Edges (lines) show relationships between concepts, predominantly labeled "belong to," indicating hierarchical or associative links. The graph likely illustrates the structure or interdependencies within a specific knowledge domain, aiding analysis of its organization and complexity within the paper. -->

Figure 3. Computer network knowledge graph

This paper focuses on the keywords "computer network basics" and "experimental tasks" in order to derive relevant knowledge. In total of 239 entities and 521 relationships. In the diagram, each node has a different colour, which means that it belongs to a different entity label. In this experiment, the acquired entities were classified into "Classification", "Knowledge Point", "Network structure level", "Concept", "Task" and other labels. The relationships involved are "Contains", "Belongs to", "Associated Knowledge", "Subtask" and so on.

SmartKG can search for knowledge by querying, as shown in Figure 4. By inputting the keyword "Router", and then the relevant knowledge points will appear. Take the knowledge point "Router" as an example, it is both a key knowledge point in the theory class and a equipment that is required everywhere in the practical class. As the teaching requires students to have a high level of knowledge about routers and the ability to apply this knowledge, it can be displayed in the form of knowledge graph, which can enable students to master the required knowledge content in different learning periods. As shown in Figure 5, the router knowledge graph contains the basic attributes "definition", "english name", "function", "performance indicator" and "port". Moreover, it is one of the network transmission media. At the same time, the knowledge point "Router" involves many experimental tasks, such as "Basic configuration of a router" "LAN users accessing the Internet through a router" "Accessing the Internet through a wireless routing relationship", and so on.

<!-- Image Description: The image displays a search results interface. A search for "Router" yielded three results: "Router," "Router configuration command," and "Router and layer 3 switch." The interface shows a search bar, the number of results found (3), and a button to collapse all results. The image likely illustrates a search function within a network configuration or documentation tool. -->

<!-- Image Description: This image is a knowledge graph visualizing relationships related to the term "Router." The central node, colored crimson, represents "Router." Gray nodes represent related concepts (e.g., "LAN port," "definition"), while red nodes denote relational terms (e.g., "belong to," "related knowledge"). Arrows indicate the direction of relationships between nodes, illustrating a network of interconnected concepts within the context of a router. The graph likely serves to illustrate knowledge representation or semantic relationships in the paper. -->

The knowledge graph and research method discussed in this paper have been applied to the teaching practice. This study selected two classes and set them as control group and experimental group respectively. In the experimental group, the constructed knowledge graph were applied in the teaching practice process; in the control group, the lessons were taught according to the conventional teaching methods. By analyzing the multi-dimensional data such as students' interest in and enjoyment of the course, students' participation in classes, and students' academic achievements. The results of the two classes are compared as shown in Table 4. The research shows that the application of knowledge graph in the teaching process can improve students' academic performance and promote the improvement of teaching quality.

### IV. CONCLUSION

This paper takes the teaching content of the computer network course group as the core, involving theory and experimental operation. Firstly, we introduce the overview of knowledge graph, the construction process and the use of SmartKG application software; then we elaborate the methods applied in this paper and the experimental results in turn from four aspects: data acquisition, keyword extraction, relationship extraction and knowledge storage. The key to teaching computer networks is the common development of theory and practice, not only to cultivate students' mastery of theoretical knowledge, but also to focus on students' practical operation ability. In the process of rapid construction and development of a skill-based society, it is the key to vocational education to let students enjoy and apply their skills.
