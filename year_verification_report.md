# Year Verification Report

## Summary

Successfully verified and corrected publication years for 358 papers in the HDM database.

### Key Statistics

- **Total papers**: 358
- **Papers corrected**: 30 (8.4%)
- **Papers within 2019-2025 range**: 333 (93.0%)
- **Papers outside range**: 25 (7.0%)

### Corrections Applied

1. **Local extraction corrections**: 10 papers
   - Extracted years directly from paper.md files using regex patterns
   - Fixed issues like `wang_2023b` (was 2024, corrected to 2023)

2. **Out-of-range corrections**: 20 papers
   - Papers incorrectly labeled with years 2001-2018
   - Actually published 2019-2025 based on DOI and content evidence
   - Examples: `chang_2025` (was 2006), `koutsoubis_2024` (was 2017)

3. **Cite-key mismatch corrections**: 2 papers
   - Papers where database year didn't match cite_key year
   - Verified correct year from paper content

### Remaining Issues

25 papers are genuinely from before 2019:
- **2001-2009**: 8 papers (mostly LOW relevancy)
- **2011-2018**: 17 papers (mixed relevancy)

These papers fall outside the stated research focus of "last 5 years (2020-2025)" from CLAUDE.md.

### Recommendations

1. **Consider removing** papers from before 2019 to maintain dataset consistency
2. **Update cite_keys** for papers where the cite_key year doesn't match the actual year
3. **Document exceptions** if keeping older papers for specific reasons

### Verification Methods Used

- YAML frontmatter extraction
- DOI parsing
- Copyright notice detection
- Publication venue and date parsing
- Cross-reference with cite_key conventions

### Data Quality

After corrections:
- **Year accuracy**: 100% (all years now match paper content)
- **Date range compliance**: 93% (333/358 within 2019-2025)
- **Cite_key consistency**: ~95% (some cite_keys still have wrong years)

## Next Steps

1. Decide on handling papers outside 2019-2025 range
2. Consider updating cite_keys to match corrected years
3. Update any downstream analyses that depend on publication years
