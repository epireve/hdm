**Abstract:** Background/Objectives: Physical activity (PA) has many benefits for both physical and cognitive health. It has also been related to improvements in memory and executive functions. However, its impact on time estimation remains less explored. Time is a key component of episodic memory, which also involves spatial components to give a full context to events. Given the clear evidence of the benefits of PA in spatial navigation and the anatomical overlap with temporal estimation through the hippocampus, the latter could be affected in a similar way. Therefore, this study aimed to check how PA can influence time processing and spatial memory. We wanted to check if PA influenced time and space with the same directionality. **Methods:** Forty-two (*n* = 42) female university students participated in this study, divided into a Sport (*n* = 25) or Sedentary (*n*= 17) Group depending on their participation in PA for a minimum of 3 h a week. They were addressed in two different cognitive capabilities. The first was time processing, measured by the Time Comparison Task, which controlled for several key aspects of time literature in its design. Moreover, we measured spatial navigation skills, using a well-proven virtual spatial navigation task, The Boxes Room. Accuracy and mean response times were registered per task. **Results:** Significant correlations were observed between spatial and temporal task performance. In addition, PA influenced spatial and time processing in a similar way, with the Sport Group outperforming the Sedentary Group in accuracy and response times for both tasks. **Conclusions:** These findings provide evidence that PA influences time processing similarly to its established effects on spatial memory, which could help developing sports programs that further enhance this skill.

## 1. Introduction

Physical activity (PA) is widely considered a key component of an optimal state of health. It is a category that can include many activities, such as sports practice, alongside leisure activities, planned exercises, and dancing, having in common the involvement of a body movement with the contraction of skeletal muscles [1]. There is a considerable international impulse to promote a more active lifestyle in the population, as it can successfully prevent many chronic diseases and the consequences of a sedentary lifestyle [2,3]. Among the many benefits of PA, we can find a reduced risk of developing many organic diseases such as hypertension, obesity, and diabetes, among others [4,5]. PA can also help reduce the mental health risks for conditions such as depression [1].

However, the benefits are not only focused on preventing disease or improving the fitness of the body. A physically active lifestyle can also help enhance brain function in several populations. There are meta-analyses reporting a general benefit of PA in cognitive processes such as attention, motor control, or visuospatial memory [6,7]. Other studies show benefits in executive control [8], motor inhibition, and cognitive flexibility [9].

Moreover, PA results in clear improvements in learning tasks that are dependent on hippocampus learning, thus demanding the encoding of spatial signals that can form a cognitive map of the environment [10]. Therefore, physically active individuals are able to outperform sedentary participants in spatial navigation tasks in both animals [11,12] and humans [13–15]. This also extends to the implementation of training programs on untrained individuals. A review [16] identified improvements in several tasks related to navigation and orientation after physical training. Advancements in technology have fostered progress within this field of study, specifically through the development of virtual spatial navigation tasks. A key advantage of these tasks, relative to traditional spatial measures, is their enhanced ecological validity, attributed to their capacity to assess cognitive skills pertinent to real-world navigation [17]. These tasks were able to find clear reliable differences due to PA in previous studies [13,14].

However, among cognitive functions and how PA can affect them, the processing of time is less studied. Considering the possible models of its functioning, clock timing theories [18] state that time pieces are stored in working memory, which works in unison with long-term memory to make temporal judgments. Other authors consider time to be widespread in several regions that are involved depending on the demand [19,20]. Interestingly, there is more evidence that might indicate an influence of PA on time processing, which is related to its anatomical overlap with spatial processes. Some authors relate the hippocampus to time processing [21], and the entorhinal cortex is also involved [22], which are both relevant structures to spatial memory [23]. Furthermore, the hippocampal place cells that fire in response to exploring the environment [24,25] can also act as time cells, encoding the particular chronology of events alongside their placement in space [26]. Additionally, working memory, a key component of time processing, is also said to influence allocentric spatial navigation [27]. Thus, and given the extensive literature in this matter, any potential benefit of PA on spatial cognition should follow the same pattern and directionality for time perception and processing due to these anatomical and functional overlaps.

A potential difficulty in properly revealing time processing and the mediator role of PA is related to the methodology of the tasks involved in its assessment, on the contrary to spatial memory assessment. Some of the studies mentioned above do not purely measure the time separated from other processes, which could influence the outcome [28]. Thus, developing a purer measure of strict time-related processes, with minimal cross-cognitive processing, may be beneficial in further disclosure of these tendencies. On this note, there
