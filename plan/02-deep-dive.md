# Phase 2: Deep Dive and Reference Extraction

**Objective:** To conduct a detailed analysis of each reference to determine its suitability for inclusion in the research table.

**Process for Each Reference:**

1.  **Locate and Access:**
    *   Use the provided URL or DOI to find the paper online.
    *   If the direct link is broken, use search engines (Google Scholar, etc.) to find an alternative source.
    *   If the paper is behind a paywall and no open-access version is available, note this and move to the next reference.

2.  **Initial Skim (5 minutes):**
    *   Read the abstract, introduction, and conclusion to get a quick understanding of the paper's contribution.
    *   Check the publication date to ensure it is within the last 5 years.
    *   If the paper is clearly not relevant, discard it and move on.

3.  **Detailed Reading and Extraction:**
    *   If the paper seems relevant, proceed with a more detailed reading.
    *   As you read, have the `research_table.md` columns in mind and actively look for the required information.
    *   Use a separate notes file for each paper to jot down key findings and quotes.

4.  **Populate Extraction Template:**
    *   For each paper, fill out a template with the information for each column of the research table. This will streamline the final population of the markdown table.
