## Quick Start Guide

### Phase 1: Recent High-Impact Coverage (Month 1)

**Week 1: Setup & Infrastructure**
```bash
# Configure MCP servers
claude --mcp-config

# Test search automation
python setup_search_pipeline.py

# Initialize progress tracking
python init_progress_tracker.py
```

**Week 2-3: Systematic Searches**
- arXiv 2024-2025 comprehensive search
- Recent conference mining (VLDB, SIGMOD, WWW, CHI)
- Citation network expansion from core papers

**Week 4: Assessment & Consolidation**
- Full-text review and quality assessment
- Gap analysis and progress evaluation
- Phase 2 preparation

### Key Tools & Resources

**MCP Servers:**
- `paper-search-mcp`: Academic paper search across databases
- `sci-hub-mcp-server`: Access to paywalled papers (key: cc296018-66f4-4825-870c-5038702af3ce)

**Automation Scripts:**
- Search query generator and executor
- Quality assessment automation
- Progress tracking and reporting
- Citation network analysis

**Quality Standards:**
- Minimum relevance score: 3.0/5.0 for PKG/HDM focus
- Target quality distribution: 15% Tier 1, 35% Tier 2, 35% Tier 3, 15% Tier 4
- Coverage targets: 50+ temporal KG, 30+ privacy-preserving, 25+ multimodal

## Research Gap Priorities

### Critical Gaps (High Priority)
1. **Temporal Coverage**: Recent work 2024-2025 (Target: +40 papers)
2. **Cross-Disciplinary**: HCI, cognitive science, psychology (Target: +25 papers)
3. **Privacy-Preserving**: Federated learning, differential privacy (Target: +20 papers)
4. **Evaluation Frameworks**: Benchmarks and metrics (Target: +15 papers)
5. **Real-world Systems**: Implementation case studies (Target: +10 papers)

### Coverage Targets by Research Dimension
- **Temporal KG**: 15 ‚Üí 50+ papers
- **Privacy-Preserving**: 8 ‚Üí 30+ papers  
- **Multimodal Integration**: 5 ‚Üí 25+ papers
- **Evaluation Frameworks**: 3 ‚Üí 20+ papers
- **Healthcare Applications**: 12 ‚Üí 25+ papers

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Targets (3-Month Timeline)
- **Final Corpus Size**: 200+ papers in research table
- **Quality Average**: 3.5+ composite score
- **Temporal Coverage**: Balanced 2020-2025 distribution
- **Venue Diversity**: 50+ different publication venues
- **Citation Impact**: 30% with 10+ citations

### Research Impact Goals
- Definitive systematic review corpus for PKG/HDM domain
- Foundation for high-impact survey paper publication
- Comprehensive basis for proof-of-concept development
- Identification of all major research opportunities and gaps

## Risk Management

### Primary Risks & Mitigations
1. **Search Exhaustion**: Clear stopping criteria, expert consultation fallback
2. **Access Limitations**: Multiple access strategies including sci-hub integration
3. **Quality Drift**: Regular calibration sessions and strict criteria adherence
4. **Timeline Pressure**: Parallel processing and clear prioritization

### Quality Assurance
- Automated duplicate detection and relevance filtering
- Weekly progress reviews and milestone tracking
- Inter-rater reliability monitoring (target: ‚â•0.8)
- Expert validation of final corpus
