# Phase 3: Data Synthesis and Table Population

**Objective:** To synthesize the extracted information and populate the `research_table.md`.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Process Extraction Templates:**
    *   Go through the completed extraction templates from Phase 2.
    *   Consolidate the notes and ensure the information is concise and accurately reflects the source paper.

2.  **Populate the Research Table:**
    *   For each paper, create a new row in `research_table.md`.
    *   Carefully copy the information from the extraction template into the corresponding columns of the markdown table.
    *   Ensure the markdown formatting is correct.

3.  **Download and Organize Papers:**
    *   For each paper that was accessible, download the PDF.
    *   Save the PDF in the `papers` directory.
    *   Use a consistent naming convention for the files (e.g., `Author-Year-Title.pdf`).
    *   Update the "Downloaded" column in the research table to "Yes".

4.  **Handle Missing Information:**
    *   If any information for a particular column could not be found in the paper, leave that cell blank.
    *   Do not try to infer or guess information that is not explicitly stated.

5.  **Add Tags:**
    *   For the "Tags" column, add relevant keywords that will help in filtering and searching the table later. Examples: `PKG`, `HDM`, `Data Integration`, `Temporal Reasoning`, `Entity Resolution`, etc.
