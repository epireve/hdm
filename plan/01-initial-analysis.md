# Phase 1: Initial Analysis and Triage

**Objective:** To perform a high-level review of each of the four provided markdown files to understand their core themes, arguments, and the scope of their references.

**File:** `pkg-architecture-gaps.md`

**Tasks:**

1.  **Read and Summarize:** Read the document to understand its central argument about the architectural gaps in PKGs for software engineering.
2.  **Identify Key Themes:** Note the key challenges identified, such as data integration, scalability, and semantic integration.
3.  **Extract References:** Systematically extract all references from the document, noting the provided URLs.
4.  **Initial Relevancy Assessment:** Make a preliminary judgment on the relevance of each reference to the core research focus.

**File:** `pkg-data-integration.md`

**Tasks:**

1.  **Read and Summarize:** Read the document to understand its focus on data integration and heterogeneity challenges in PKGs for HDM.
2.  **Identify Key Themes:** Note the specific challenges outlined in the "Consolidated Challenge Matrix."
3.  **Extract References:** Systematically extract all references, paying close attention to the context in which they are cited.
4.  **Initial Relevancy Assessment:** Assess the relevance of each reference, prioritizing those that directly address data integration, heterogeneity, and temporal context.

**File:** `pkg-design-pattens.md`

**Tasks:**

1.  **Read and Summarize:** Read the document to understand the proposed design patterns for a universal PKG framework.
2.  **Identify Key Patterns:** Note the core architectural, data management, and knowledge representation patterns discussed.
3.  **Extract References:** Extract all references, noting how they support the proposed design patterns.
4.  **Initial Relevancy Assessment:** Evaluate the relevance of each reference to the practical implementation of a PKG for HDM.

**File:** `pkg-systematic-bespoke.md`

**Tasks:**

1.  **Read and Summarize:** Read the document to understand its systematic review of bespoke knowledge graph frameworks for HDM.
2.  **Identify Key Arguments:** Note the arguments for the technical feasibility and research worthiness of developing such frameworks.
3.  **Extract References:** Extract all references, paying attention to those that support the claims about the maturity of knowledge graph technologies.
4.  **Initial Relevancy Assessment:** Assess the relevance of each reference, particularly those that provide evidence for the feasibility of the proposed research.
