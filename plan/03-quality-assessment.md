}
```

#### 2. Citation Impact Score (1-5)
**Objective:** Assess the research impact and influence of the paper

**Age-Adjusted Scoring:**
```python
def calculate_citation_impact(paper):
    age = 2024 - paper.year
    raw_citations = paper.citation_count
    
    # Expected citations by age (conservative estimates)
    expected_thresholds = {
        0: [0, 1, 2, 5, 10],      # 2024 papers
        1: [0, 2, 5, 15, 30],     # 2023 papers  
        2: [0, 5, 15, 40, 80],    # 2022 papers
        3: [1, 10, 30, 70, 150],  # 2021 papers
        4: [2, 15, 50, 100, 200], # 2020 papers
    }
    
    thresholds = expected_thresholds.get(age, expected_thresholds[4])
    
    for score, threshold in enumerate(thresholds, 1):
        if raw_citations >= threshold:
            continue
        return score - 1 if score > 1 else 1
    
    return 5  # Exceptional citation count
```

**Special Considerations:**
- **Highly Cited Recent Papers**: 2024-2025 papers with >10 citations get bonus consideration
- **Field Adjustment**: Adjust expectations for specialized domains (e.g., healthcare informatics)
- **Self-Citations**: Discount excessive self-citations if detectable

### Composite Quality Score Calculation

#### Weighted Scoring Formula
```python
def calculate_composite_quality_score(paper):
    weights = {
        "venue_prestige": 0.25,
        "citation_impact": 0.20,
        "technical_depth": 0.25,
        "novelty": 0.15,
        "evaluation_rigor": 0.15

    }
    
    return justifications[score]
```

### Quality Assurance Processes

#### Inter-Rater Reliability
```python
def calculate_inter_rater_reliability():
    # Sample of papers assessed by multiple reviewers
    sample_papers = random.sample(assessed_papers, 50)
    
    for paper in sample_papers:
        scores_reviewer_1 = assess_quality(paper, reviewer="primary")
        scores_reviewer_2 = assess_quality(paper, reviewer="secondary")
        
        agreement = calculate_agreement(scores_reviewer_1, scores_reviewer_2)
        
    overall_reliability = aggregate_agreement_scores()
    
    if overall_reliability < 0.8:
        trigger_calibration_session()
    
    return overall_reliability
```

#### Regular Calibration
```python
def conduct_calibration_session():
    # Select diverse sample of papers
    calibration_set = select_calibration_papers()
    
    # Independent assessment by all reviewers
    reviewer_scores = {}
    for reviewer in reviewers:
        reviewer_scores[reviewer] = assess_calibration_set(calibration_set, reviewer)
    
    # Identify discrepancies and discuss
    discrepancies = identify_scoring_discrepancies(reviewer_scores)
    
    # Update scoring guidelines based on discussion
    update_scoring_guidelines(discrepancies)
    
    # Re-assess problematic cases
    reassess_problematic_papers(discrepancies)
```

### Quality Distribution Targets

#### Target Distribution for Final Corpus
```python
TARGET_QUALITY_DISTRIBUTION = {
    "Tier 1 (4.5-5.0)": {"percentage": 15, "min_papers": 30},    # Exceptional quality
    "Tier 2 (3.5-4.4)": {"percentage": 35, "min_papers": 70},   # High quality  
    "Tier 3 (2.5-3.4)": {"percentage": 35, "min_papers": 70},   # Good quality
    "Tier 4 (1.5-2.4)": {"percentage": 15, "min_papers": 30},   # Acceptable quality
    "Tier 5 (1.0-1.4)": {"percentage": 0,  "min_papers": 0}     # Exclude low quality
}
```

#### Quality Monitoring Dashboard
```python
def generate_quality_dashboard():
    current_distribution = calculate_current_distribution()
    
    dashboard = {
        "quality_distribution": current_distribution,
        "target_alignment": assess_target_alignment(current_distribution),
        "quality_trends": analyze_quality_trends(),
        "outlier_papers": identify_quality_outliers(),
        "recommendations": generate_quality_recommendations()
    }
    
    return dashboard
```

### Implementation Workflow

#### Daily Quality Assessment
```python
def daily_quality_assessment():
    # Assess new papers from daily searches
    new_papers = get_daily_search_results()
    
    for paper in new_papers:
        quality_scores = calculate_composite_quality_score(paper)
        relevance_score = assess_pkg_relevance(paper)
        
        paper.quality_assessment = {
            "quality_scores": quality_scores,
            "relevance_score": relevance_score,
            "assessment_date": datetime.now(),
            "reviewer": get_current_reviewer()
        }
        
        # Auto-exclude very low quality/relevance
        if quality_scores["composite_score"] < 1.5 or relevance_score < 2:
            paper.status = "excluded_quality"
        else:
            paper.status = "quality_approved"
    
    # Update quality monitoring
    update_quality_metrics(new_papers)
```
