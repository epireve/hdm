# Comprehensive Systematic Review Plan for HDM/PKG Research

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines a systematic approach to achieve exhaustive coverage of Personal Knowledge Graph (PKG) and Human Digital Memory (HDM) research literature. Our current corpus contains 85 papers with complete analysis and 496 papers tracked in progress cache, providing a solid foundation. However, significant gaps exist that require systematic expansion to create a truly comprehensive research corpus.

**Current State:**
- 85 papers in research table with full 21-column analysis
- 496 papers tracked in progress cache (75 processed, 12 pending)
- Strong coverage of basic PKG concepts and healthcare applications
- Identified critical gaps in temporal modeling, cross-disciplinary work, and recent publications

**Strategic Objective:**
Expand to 200+ papers with systematic coverage of all research dimensions for authoritative HDM/PKG systematic review.

## Research Gaps Identified

### Critical Gaps (High Priority)
1. **Temporal Coverage**: Only 20% from 2024-2025, missing recent advances

4. **Evaluation Frameworks**: Insufficient benchmarks and standardized metrics
5. **Real-world Systems**: Need more implementation case studies

### Technical Architecture Gaps (Medium Priority)
1. **Edge Computing**: Local PKG processing for privacy/latency
2. **Multimodal Integration**: Voice, gesture, sensor data fusion
3. **Real-time Updates**: Streaming KG architectures
4. **User Control**: Data sovereignty and consent mechanisms

### Coverage Targets
- **Temporal KG**: 50+ papers (current: ~15)
- **Privacy-Preserving**: 30+ papers (current: ~8)
- **Multimodal Integration**: 25+ papers (current: ~5)
