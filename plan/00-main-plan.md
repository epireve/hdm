# Comprehensive Analysis and Synthesis Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive plan to analyze the provided research documents, extract relevant information, and populate the research table. The plan is divided into several phases, each with specific objectives and tasks.

## Phase 1: Initial Analysis and Triage (File: 01-initial-analysis.md)

- **Objective:** To perform a high-level review of each of the four provided markdown files to understand their core themes, arguments, and the scope of their references.
- **Tasks:**
    1.  Read each markdown file (`pkg-architecture-gaps.md`, `pkg-data-integration.md`, `pkg-design-pattens.md`, `pkg-systematic-bespoke.md`).
    2.  Identify the main research questions and contributions of each document.
    3.  Create a preliminary list of all unique references (papers, articles, etc.) cited across the four documents.
    4.  Categorize the references based on their apparent relevance to the core research focus (Data Integration, Heterogeneity, PKG Architectures for HDM).

## Phase 2: Deep Dive and Reference Extraction (File: 02-deep-dive.md)

- **Objective:** To conduct a detailed analysis of each reference to determine its suitability for inclusion in the research table.
- **Tasks:**
    1.  For each unique reference identified in Phase 1, attempt to locate and access the full paper online.
    2.  Prioritize papers published within the last 5 years.
    3.  For each accessible paper, perform a detailed reading to extract the information required for the research table columns.
    4.  Pay special attention to the "Relevancy" and "Relevancy Justification" columns, ensuring a clear connection to the research focus.

## Phase 3: Data Synthesis and Table Population (File: 03-synthesis-and-population.md)

- **Objective:** To synthesize the extracted information and populate the `research_table.md`.
- **Tasks:**
    1.  For each paper that passes the deep dive analysis, create a new row in the `research_table.md`.
    2.  Fill in all the columns of the research table with the extracted information.
    3.  For the "Downloaded" column, mark as "Yes" if the paper was successfully downloaded and "No" otherwise. Store downloaded papers in the `papers` directory.
    4.  Ensure that the `url` and `DOI` columns are accurately filled.

## Phase 4: Review and Refinement (File: 04-review-and-refinement.md)

- **Objective:** To review the populated research table for accuracy, completeness, and consistency.
- **Tasks:**
    1.  Perform a final review of the `research_table.md` to check for any missing or inconsistent information.
    2.  Verify that all downloaded papers are correctly stored in the `papers` directory.
    3.  Update the `changelog.md` to reflect the work done.
