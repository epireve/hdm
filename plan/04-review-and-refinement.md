# Phase 4: Review and Refinement

**Objective:** To review the populated research table for accuracy, completeness, and consistency.

**Review Checklist:**

1.  **Accuracy:**
    *   Spot-check a few entries in the research table against the original papers to ensure the extracted information is accurate.
    *   Verify that the `url` and `DOI` links are correct.

2.  **Completeness:**
    *   Scan the table for any obviously missing information that should have been available in the papers.
    *   Ensure that the "Downloaded" status is correctly marked for all papers.

3.  **Consistency:**
    *   Check for consistency in formatting and terminology across the table.
    *   Ensure that the relevancy ratings are applied consistently based on the defined research focus.

4.  **File Organization:**
    *   Verify that all downloaded papers are correctly named and stored in the `papers` directory.

5.  **Changelog Update:**
    *   Update the `changelog.md` with a summary of the work completed in this analysis phase.
    *   Note the number of papers analyzed and added to the research table.

**Final Output:**

*   A fully populated `research_table.md`.
*   A `papers` directory containing the downloaded PDFs.
*   An updated `changelog.md`.
