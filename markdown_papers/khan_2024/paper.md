## ABSTRACT

Large Language Models (LLMs), e.g., ChatGPT, PaLM, and LLaMA are transforming natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI). Recent LLMs browse Web knowledge and learn from external knowledge bases, unifying LLMs and knowledge graphs (KGs). The possibility of bridging KGs with LLMs has garnered attention in knowledge engineering. On the one hand, LLMs can be enhanced with KGs to provide answers with more contextualized facts. On the other hand, downstream tasks, e.g., KG curation, embedding, and search can also benefit by adopting LLMs. It remains an interesting direction to explore effective interactions between LLMs and KGs, where many recent advances arise from NLP, deep learning, information retrieval, and computer vision domains. The workshop, titled "LLM+KG: Data Management Opportunities in Unifying Large Language Models+Knowledge Graphs", is targeted at data management researchers, aiming to discuss interesting opportunities, e.g., data cleaning, modeling, designing of algorithms and systems, scalability, fairness, privacy, usability, and explanation.

## TL;DR
Research on data management opportunities in unifying large language models+knowledge graphs providing insights for knowledge graph development and data integration.

## Key Insights  
Contributes to the broader understanding of knowledge graph technologies and data management practices relevant to PKG system development.

## 1 WORKSHOP TOPICS AND GOALS

The advent of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT [[42]](#ref-42), PaLM [[13]](#ref-13), and LLaMA [[61]](#ref-61), provides promising capabilities in artificial general intelligence (AGI), demonstrating excellent performance in natural language processing (NLP), e.g., comprehension and generation of human-like texts, sentiment analysis, language translation, question-answering (QA), document classification, summarization, content generation, and virtual assistants, in domains including customer support, healthcare, finance, law, education, engineering, etc. [[4]](#ref-4), [[20]](#ref-20), [[33]](#ref-33), [[55]](#ref-55), [[71]](#ref-71), [[74]](#ref-74), [[77]](#ref-77), [[80]](#ref-80). LLMs are pre-trained on massive text corpora and then fine-tuned through task-specific objectives. Additionally, prompting enables a novel interaction mode with LLMs that does not involve training of model parameters. Prompt engineering designs the inputs given to a model to guide the desired outputs â€“ either via zero-shot prompting, where the model is not provided with any direct examples; or via few-shot prompting, when

a few examples consisting of sample inputs and expected outputs are provided to the model, along with the user's query, in order to adopt the model to a certain response format, also known as the in-context learning. Furthermore, the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a paradigm in which a large language model references authoritative knowledge sources outside of its training data before generating a response, thereby optimizing its output. Major technology companies, such as Google, IBM, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Baidu have engaged in competitive rivalries for creating larger and better LLMs, as well as deployed them across commercial products and services to numerous business functions [[81]](#ref-81), [[89]](#ref-89).

LLMs, pre-trained on large-scale web and enterprise corpus, encode significant knowledge implicitly in their parameters without human supervision, which can be probed for various QA and querying tasks, thus LLMs act as knowledge bases (KBs) [[3]](#ref-3), [[22]](#ref-22), [[46]](#ref-46), [[67]](#ref-67). They generalize from the training corpus. However, LLMs are skilled at learning stochastic language patterns and may not explicitly store consistent representations of knowledge, hence they can output unreliable and incoherent responses, and often experience hallucinations by generating factually incorrect statements, or even harmful content [[17]](#ref-17), [[38]](#ref-38), [[58]](#ref-58). Like other deep neural networks, LLMs are complex "black-box" systems; knowledge in LLMs is difficult to interpret, update, and is prone to bias, rendering it hard to deploy them in decision-critical applications [[43]](#ref-43), [[88]](#ref-88).

Knowledge graphs (KGs), in contrast, enable a structured, highly-curated, and reliable representation of knowledge via explicit relationships, supporting symbolic reasoning and inference, with explainability [[12]](#ref-12), [[24]](#ref-24), [[25]](#ref-25), [[72]](#ref-72). KGs such as DBpedia [[5]](#ref-5), Freebase [[10]](#ref-10), YAGO [[57]](#ref-57), Wikidata [[65]](#ref-65), and NELL [[11]](#ref-11) store real-world facts as <subject, predicate, object> triples. They may also be represented as large-scale graphs with entities as nodes and relationships between these entities as edges. Almost all big data companies, e.g., Google, Microsoft, IBM, Meta, Amazon, and eBay have proprietary KGs [[41]](#ref-41). Commonsense knowledge graphs [[28]](#ref-28), [[29]](#ref-29), [[87]](#ref-87), KGs for synonyms and translations in different languages [[40]](#ref-40), [[56]](#ref-56), domain-specific KGs [[1]](#ref-1), and multi-modal KGs [[18]](#ref-18), [[37]](#ref-37), [[68]](#ref-68) are created. They offer accurate explicit knowledge in many downstream applications including web search, QA [[50]](#ref-50), semantic search [[70]](#ref-70), personal assistants [[9]](#ref-9), fact-checking [[60]](#ref-60), and recommendation [[78]](#ref-78). KGs can also be updated dynamically with new knowledge via the addition or deletion of triples [[75]](#ref-75).

However, knowledge graphs are difficult to construct and are often incomplete. Non-professional users find it challenging to write an accurate query, e.g., via SPARQL, Cypher [[19]](#ref-19), Gremlin [[49]](#ref-49), GSQL [[15]](#ref-15), etc., since users must have full knowledge of the query language, schema, and the vocabulary used in a KG, besides the schema can be large and complex due to heterogeneity. Current KG

querying approaches generally lack language understanding, are inadequate to deal with unseen entities and new facts, and often ignore multi-modal information in KGs. Moreover, existing methods are tailored for specific KGs or downstream tasks, referred to as the interoperability issues [[26]](#ref-26), [[34]](#ref-34).

In summary, LLMs and KGs offer parametric vs. explicit knowledge, respectively, and can complement each other in knowledge engineering. Recently, efforts have been made to unify LLMs and KGs by leveraging their advantages [[2]](#ref-2), [[39]](#ref-39), [[43]](#ref-43), [[44]](#ref-44), [[53]](#ref-53), [[82]](#ref-82). KGs assist in the pre-training and inference phases of LLMs, e.g., through retrieval-augmented methods, to provide external knowledge for reducing hallucinations, thus improving accuracy and offering interpretability. LLMs, on the other hand, facilitate knowledge extraction, KG creation, completion, embedding, and various downstream tasks over KGs. In the following, we briefly discuss the synergy between LLMs and KGs, and how they benefit each other.

KGs for LLMs. LLMs may fail to understand a question due to lack of context, might suffer from a knowledge gap, or simply cannot recall facts. Therefore, offering external knowledge through knowledge graphs is becoming prevalent for enhancing the accuracy, consistency, transparency, and the overall capabilities of LLMs.

*   *KG-enhanced Pre-training:* Adding knowledge graphs to the training corpus improves pre-training data quality and context, thereby improving LLMs' accuracy. Notable works include KnowBERT [[45]](#ref-45) which embeds multiple KGs into LLMs by updating contextual word representations with relevant entity embeddings via word-to-entity attention. K-BERT [[36]](#ref-36) injects KG triples into texts to construct sentence trees for training, thus incorporating domain knowledge into LLMs. KEPLER [[69]](#ref-69) encodes textual entity descriptions with language models as embeddings, and jointly optimizes KG embeddings and language modeling objectives. DRAGON [[84]](#ref-84) pre-trains a joint language-knowledge foundation model from KG and text.

*   *KG-enhanced Fine-tuning:* Knowledge graphs can assist in fine-tuning LLMs to update their internal knowledge for domain-specific tasks over KGs [[8]](#ref-8), [[32]](#ref-32). RuleBERT [[51]](#ref-51) fine-tunes an LLM utilizing the Horn rules to incorporate commonsense knowledge. However, it is also costly to fine-tune LLMs to update their knowledge.

*   *KG-enhanced Inference:* Sequeda et al. show that using KGs attains higher accuracy for LLM-powered QA systems with zero-shot prompting [[53]](#ref-53). The Knowledge Prompts approach trains soft prompts via self-supervised learning based on KGs; the resulting soft knowledge prompts inject world knowledge and new evolving information into LLMs [[16]](#ref-16). Baek et al. propose KAPING [[7]](#ref-7), which first retrieves KG facts relevant to the input question, then prepends the retrieved facts to the question as a prompt to LLMs for the desired output. Wu et al. rewrite the extracted KG triples into well-textualized statements to enhance the accuracy of LLMs [[76]](#ref-76). Advanced prompting techniques such as chain-of-thought and graph-of-thought can facilitate retrieving relevant external knowledge for LLMs to improve their reasoning capacity [[23]](#ref-23), [[62]](#ref-62), [[73]](#ref-73).

*   *KG-enhanced Validation and Explainability:* KGs provide explanations and fact-checking to justify LLMs' decisions. LAMA [[46]](#ref-46) probes LLMs by using KGs â€“ it converts KG triples into cloze statements following a prompt template and exploits LLMs to predict the missing entity. Autoprompt [[54]](#ref-54) generates prompts automatically for various tasks via a gradient-guided search. QA-GNN [[85]](#ref-85) develops

an end-to-end QA model leveraging language models and KGs, and performs interpretable reasoning.

LLMs for KGs. LLMs augment KGs via knowledge extraction, auto-completion, and by considering multi-modal information, as well as enhance the usability and performance of downstream tasks with natural language understanding and generalization capabilities.
*   *LLM-enhanced KG Creation:* KGs are difficult to construct due to information extraction and integration from diverse sources. Multimodal LLMs are well-equipped to extract knowledge from heterogeneous data including text, images, tables, etc. [[14]](#ref-14), [[64]](#ref-64), [[66]](#ref-66). LLMs are also employed in entity and relation discovery, typing, resolution, linking, and end-to-end construction of KGs [[31]](#ref-31), [[66]](#ref-66), [[79]](#ref-79).

*   *LLM-enhanced KG Completion:* LLMs are extensively adopted for KG completion via link prediction. LLMs encode textual information along with KG facts for better link prediction [[83]](#ref-83). Recently, LLMs have been used as generators that predict the missing entity in a KG triple directly [[52]](#ref-52).

*   *LLM-enhanced KG Embedding:* LLMs are used for KG+text embedding, such as KEPLER [[69]](#ref-69) and K-BERT [[36]](#ref-36). LLMs with graph and image encoders are combined to train multi-modal KG embedding in [[27]](#ref-27).

*   *LLM-enhanced KG Querying:* The language understanding capacity of LLMs makes them suitable for processing natural language questions (NLQs) over structured KGs. LLMs assist in extracting entities and relations from NLQs, as well as in the answer reasoning process (e.g., QA-GNN [[85]](#ref-85)). Avila et al. evaluate the ability of Chat-GPT to translate the user's NLQs to SPARQL queries on the KG [[6]](#ref-6). Relevant facts from KGs can be employed as external knowledge in retrieval-augmented LLMs to answer queries [[7]](#ref-7), [[23]](#ref-23), [[76]](#ref-76).

*   *LLM-enhanced KG Analytics:* LLMs are also employed in more complex analytic tasks over graph-structured data (including KGs), commonly known as "graph reasoning", such as computing graph sizes, node degrees, node connectivity, centrality and position of nodes, etc. Various prompting-based approaches have been developed for solving natural language graph problems [[86]](#ref-86).

*   *LLM-enhanced Domain-specific KG Applications:* The synergy between KGs and LLMs is also exploited in multi-disciplinary domains including healthcare, biomedical [[59]](#ref-59), education [[35]](#ref-35), e-commerce [[47]](#ref-47), and spatio-temporal data [[30]](#ref-30).

Opportunities for Data Management Research. The unification of LLMs and KGs provides exciting data management research opportunities across multiple dimensions.

*   *Data and Input Modeling:* The graph structures need to be serialized as part of LLMs' input, either by verbalizing the graph structure in natural languages, or by encoding the sparse structure in dense vector forms. How to integrate graph structure with other multi-modal data, e.g., text, tables, and images as input to LLMs, how to extract relevant subgraphs from KGs for specific downstream tasks, and how to design and learn prompts with graph data for better generalization, are interesting open problems.

*   *Data Cleaning, Integration, and Augmentation:* Data cleaning (e.g., error detection and repairing) and integration (e.g., entity and relation extraction, entity resolution, linking) are fundamental to data management. The unification of LLMs and KGs provides new opportunities in this domain. Additionally, LLMs as generators assist in KG auto-completion and domain-specific synthetic data generation.
*   *Multi-modal Data Management:* Data are multi-modal, consisting of texts, images, tables, key-values, graphs, and other multimedia data. KGs can serve as a unified data model for cross-domain and diverse data. For example, nodes and edges in a KG may contain features of different modalities. Multi-modal LLMs are better suited to extract knowledge from heterogeneous data.

*   *Vector Data Management:* With the emergence of multi-modal KG embedding and multi-modal LLMs, vector data management is critical. Querying vectors is challenging, since they are dense and high-dimensional, rendering many indexing approaches ineffective due to the curse of dimensionality. The data management community can contribute to this field with high-dimensional data indexing, join, and geometric querying. Vector representations are also used in retrieval-augmented LLMs for efficient top-k retrievals and prompt learning with gradient-based search.

*   *Accuracy and Consistency:* Enhancing LLMs' accuracy, consistency, reducing hallucinations and harmful content generation, fake news detection, fact-checking, etc. with knowledge-grounded techniques are emerging research directions.

*   *Efficiency and Scalability:* LLM scaling laws are based on empirical observations that a larger number of parameters and tokens in a model improves performance across various downstream tasks. Consequently, the computer systems (e.g., servers, GPUs, TPUs) used to train, run, and serve predictions from these models have high-performance requirements and are expensive to procure and operate â€“ in terms of monetary costs and environmental impacts, e.g., they consume megawatt-hours of electricity and emit tons of greenhouse gasses â€“ limiting access for smaller organizations and researchers. It is, therefore, critical to optimize the performance of LLM systems, characterize resource management and techniques for training and inference, their trade-offs on accuracy requirements, compress model size, and effectively deploy these systems in production environments (e.g., at the edge).

*   *Bias and Fairness:* LLMs retain and amplify biases present in training data. LLMs' performance can be biased against long-tail entities, in comparison to popular entities. KGs can mitigate biases by providing explicit knowledge about long-tail entities. Bias in KG embeddings could be mitigated via data augmentation using LLMs.
*   *Explainability and Provenance:* KGs offer explainability to LLMs' responses by probing them and grounding their reasoning with external knowledge. It is critical to develop techniques that can associate LLM-generated content with its provenance information.

*   *Usability:* LLMs improve the interoperability of KG downstream tasks through their natural language interfaces, transferability, and generalization capacity. It would be interesting to analyze the expressiveness of KG-enhanced LLM models.

*   *Security and Privacy:* LLMs, trained on proprietary datasets, can inadvertently reveal confidential information in their responses, increasing the risk of unauthorized data access and security breaches. As the usage of graph data in LLMs expands, so does the concern for privacy and security. Ensuring the confidentiality of sensitive graph information, while still extracting knowledge for LLMs, poses an exciting challenge.

*   *Optimizing KG Databases and Systems:* Recent advances in LLM-enhanced database systems have showcased the potential to optimize querying tasks. However, complex graph structures require specialized attention. By exploiting historical usage data and graph

topology with in-context learning, LLMs can autonomously adapt storage strategies and predict access patterns.

*   *Data and AI Model Market Challenges:* Data and AI model markets enable multiple organizations to sell, discover, share, and purchase high-quality data and AI models for better training and inference. For instance, regardless of fine-tuning or the RAG paradigm, an LLM model's success depends on the nobility and fitness of the data post-training. Analogously, certain fine-tuned LLMs would be more suitable for specific downstream tasks. With the integration of LLMs and KGs, data and AI markets provide potential opportunities for effective sharing at scale, coupled with novel challenges associated with graph data and model pricing.

*   *Benchmarking and Ground Truth:* In many emerging domains such as healthcare, biomedical, education, finance, cyber security, coding, personal assistants, e-commerce, etc., the integration of LLMs and KGs have depicted incredible promises. It is important to have ground truth datasets and experimental benchmarks to facilitate future research and developments in these domains.

Goals: Why is the Workshop Important? Why Now? Large language models (LLMs) recently emerged to mainstream, and already became a powerful tool for interacting with data. LLM adoption is rapidly accelerating in the industry â€“ prominent players include Open AI (ChatGPT), Google (PaLM), Amazon (Titan, Olympus), Meta (LLaMA), Huawei (Pangu), Tencent (Hunyuan), Anthropic (Claude), Microsoft (Turing-NLG, Orca), etc. Most teams using LLMs are investing in prompt engineering, vector databases, and LLMs' monitoring (e.g., Responsible AI). The global LLM market size in terms of revenue is projected to reach 259,886.45 Million USD by 2029 from 1,302.93 Million USD in 2023, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) 141.72% during 2023-2029 [[48]](#ref-48). Given that the space is so new, it is an exciting time to be working at the cutting edge of LLMs. This technology also created several opportunities for applications in the general data management [[21]](#ref-21), [[63]](#ref-63).

However, LLMs on graph data and in particular, the synergy between LLMs and knowledge graphs (KGs) has received less attention from graph data management, and by the DB community in general. This workshop's objective is to draw attention to this emerging topic, which has the potential to not only deepen LLMs' impact in real-world KG and graph data applications, but also to enhance the performance of LLMs using external knowledge from KGs. Therefore, our workshop is timely and relevant.
