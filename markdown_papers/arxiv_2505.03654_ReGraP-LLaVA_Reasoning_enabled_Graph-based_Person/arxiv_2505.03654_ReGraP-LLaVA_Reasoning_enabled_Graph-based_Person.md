### Abstract

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of multimodal tasks. Recent advances in personalized MLLMs enable effective capture of user-specific concepts, supporting both recognition of personalized concepts and contextual captioning. However, humans typically explore and reason over relations among objects and individuals, transcending surface-level information to achieve more personalized and contextual understanding. To this end, existing methods may face three main limitations: (1) Their training data lacks multi-object sets in which relations among objects are learnable, (2) Existing models often neglect the connections between different personalized concepts, thereby failing to perform reasoning over them, (3) Their experiments mainly focus on a single personalized concept, where evaluations are limited to recognition and captioning tasks. To address the limitations, (i) We present a new dataset named ReGraP, consisting of 120 sets of personalized knowledge. Each set includes images, Knowledge Graphs (KGs), and Chain-of-Thought Question-Answering (CoT QA) pairs derived from the KGs, enabling more structured and sophisticated reasoning pathways. (ii) We propose Reasoning enabled Graphbased Personalized Large Language and Vision Assistant (ReGraP-LLaVA), an MLLM trained with the corresponding KGs and CoT QA pairs, where soft and/or hard graph prompting methods are designed to align KGs within the model's semantic space. (iii) We establish the ReGraP Benchmark, which contains diverse task types: Multiple-Choice, Fill-in-the-blank, True/False, and Descriptive questions in both open- and closed-ended settings. The proposed benchmark is designed to evaluate the relational reasoning and knowledge-connection capability of personalized MLLMs. We conduct experiments on the proposed ReGraP-LLaVA and other competitive MLLMs. Results show that the proposed model not only learns personalized knowledge but also performs relational reasoning in responses, achieving the best performance compared with the competitive methods. Codes and datasets are released at: https://github.com/xyfyyds/ReGraP.

### 1 Introduction

Achievements in MLLMs [\[1,](#page-9-0) [2,](#page-9-1) [3,](#page-9-2) [4\]](#page-9-3) have demonstrated robust capabilities in image analysis, and user prompts are employed to enable initial personalization for handling queries such as "*What is*

*<Tom> doing in this picture?*" and "*Could you find <my headphone> in this image?*". Consequently, to advance beyond the constraints of user-prompt based personalization [\[5,](#page-9-4) [6\]](#page-9-5), recent approaches [\[5,](#page-9-4) [7,](#page-9-6) [8,](#page-9-7) [9\]](#page-9-8) introduce personalized concepts (e.g., a personal item or a specific individual) into models, yielding satisfactory performance on recognition and simple QA tasks. For example, Yo'LLaVA [\[5\]](#page-9-4) introduces new tokens for representing personalized concepts to LLaVA [\[2\]](#page-9-1), achieving remarkable experimental results on personalized recognition and captioning while preserving the model's original conversational capabilities, which is the state-of-the-art approach in the personalization of MLLMs.

However, existing personalized MLLMs exhibit limitations. As illustrated in Figure [1](#page-1-0) (a), promptbased personalized MLLMs rely on user prompts as the sole source of personalized knowledge. This dependency leads to degraded performance when handling low-quality prompts and complicated tasks [\[5,](#page-9-4) [6\]](#page-9-5). Meanwhile, training-based personalized MLLMs (e.g. Yo'LLaVA) in Figure [1](#page-1-0) (b) mainly focus on concept-learning level, overlooking the human-like process of constructing a knowledge network among different items and leveraging the relations for contextual understanding [\[10,](#page-9-9) [11\]](#page-9-10).

Consider the query: "*Who can help Bocchi in lyric writing?*". Addressing it requires models not only recognize people in the image, but also identify relations among different individuals and reason over their attributes and relations. Meanwhile, the combination of graphs with MLLMs can enhance models' performance [\[12,](#page-9-11) [13\]](#page-9-12). To this end, constructing knowledge graphs (KGs) for personalized knowledge (personalized concepts, their attributes and relations) serves as a promising approach for training models to learn the relational knowledge. Besides, studies indicate that training on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) [\[14\]](#page-9-13) data improves models' reasoning performance in image-related tasks [\[15,](#page-10-0) [16\]](#page-10-1), which suggests that such data can be leveraged to enhance MLLMs' reasoning capability over personalized knowledge. Based on these insights, we raise three research questions:

- RQ1: Can we construct a dataset that integrates images, KGs, and CoT data to comprehensively encode personalized knowledge?
- RQ2: Given a dataset in RQ1, can we develop a personalized MLLM whose training framework aligns with the KGs, enabling it to learn and reason over the personalized knowledge?
- RQ3: Given a personalized MLLM in RQ2, can we evaluate its relational reasoning and knowledge connection capability, particularly for personalized queries that expect contextual responses?

In this paper, to address RQ1, we present a new dataset, ReGraP, consisting of 120 independent sets of personalized knowledge. The dataset is constructed through a data generation pipeline that builds KGs based on the images and personalized knowledge (see Figure [1](#page-1-0) left) and subsequently derives Chain-of-Thoughts Question-Answering pairs (CoT QA pairs) from the KGs. The answers in CoT QA pairs incorporate comprehensive reasoning steps. To address RQ2, we propose ReGraP-LLaVA, a novel MLLM built on LLaVA and trained using the ReGraP dataset, incorporating images, CoT QA pairs, and KGs in its training framework. To align the graph-based structure of KGs with the token-based input paradigm of LLaVA, we transform the KGs into embeddings using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and projection modules which serves as a "soft-prompt" method, and convert KGs into sequences of relational descriptions and tokenize them through reasoning tokenizers by introducing new *entity tokens* and *relation tokens* which serves as a "hard prompt" method. ReGraP- LLaVA showcases the capability to capture personalized knowledge and utilize it for relational reasoning. To address RQ3, we establish the ReGraP benchmark to assess models' reasoning and knowledge-connection capabilities, rather than restricting the evaluation to basic recognition or general captioning tasks. This benchmark spans multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, true/false, and descriptive questions, covering both open- and closed-ended settings. Experimental results show that ReGraP-LLaVA achieves high performance on both basic tasks evaluating personalized knowledge acquisition and difficult tasks requiring relational reasoning over learned knowledge.

Contributions. In summary, our main contributions are:

- We present ReGraP dataset and the data generation pipeline for personalized MLLMs, containing knowledge graph construction and CoT QA pairs generation based on the constructed KGs.
- We propose ReGraP-LLaVA, a novel MLLM leverages soft and/or hard prompts of knowledge graphs and CoT QA pairs in training, and not only learns personalized concepts but also utilizes the relational knowledge among these concepts to perform reasoning, enabling comprehensive image analysis and question-answering.
- We establish the ReGraP benchmark, comprising Multiple-Choice, Fill-in-the-blank, True/False, and Descriptive questions across both open- and closed-ended settings. This benchmark scales in difficulty, measuring models' knowledge acquisition and relational reasoning capabilities.

### 2 Related Work

Multimodal Large Language Models. Large Language Models (LLMs) [\[17,](#page-10-2) [18,](#page-10-3) [19,](#page-10-4) [20\]](#page-10-5) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in general question answering and reasoning. Building on this foundation, recent works have extended LLMs to visual domains, leading to the development of MLLMs [\[1,](#page-9-0) [2,](#page-9-1) [3,](#page-9-2) [4,](#page-9-3) [21,](#page-10-6) [22\]](#page-10-7), which process both textual inputs and images, thus are capable of handling multimodal tasks. However, although these MLLMs possess extensive knowledge for handling general tasks (e.g., recognition and captioning), the lack of user-specific information limits their capabilities in handling personalized requests. In this work, we train MLLMs to learn personalized knowledge while preserving their original conversational capabilities.

Personalizing MLLMs as AI Assistants. User prompting is a direct and effective method for guiding MLLMs to perform in accordance with users' preference. Although it is the most straightforward method with minimal cost, the performance heavily depends on the quality of user prompts and tends to degrade as task complexity increases, often yielding suboptimal results [\[5,](#page-9-4) [6\]](#page-9-5). Therefore, more advanced approaches for personalization have been proposed, which can be broadly categorized into retrieval based methods [\[8,](#page-9-7) [23,](#page-10-8) [24,](#page-10-9) [25\]](#page-10-10) and model-training based methods [\[5,](#page-9-4) [7,](#page-9-6) [9,](#page-9-8) [26\]](#page-10-11). Retrieval based methods utilize a database to store images and knowledge of personalized concepts. During inference, the system retrieves relevant information and determines whether the queried object corresponds to a personalized concept, which allows the model to remember user-specific knowledge and adapt its behavior accordingly across different scenarios. For example, RAP [\[8\]](#page-9-7) presents a retrieval-augmented module that can be integrated into existing MLLMs (e.g., LLaVA [\[2\]](#page-9-1), Phi-3V [\[27\]](#page-10-12)) to enable scenario- and user-specific responses, moving beyond generic captioning. However, these methods depend on external knowledge bases and additional pre-trained models (e.g., YOLO [\[28\]](#page-10-13)) to extract personalized knowledge, and introduces the risk of retrieving irrelevant contents. Model-training based methods introduce extra modules [\[9\]](#page-9-8) and embeddings [\[5\]](#page-9-4), training MLLMs to learn personalized concepts. These approaches rely solely on the MLLM itself for personalization, making them more lightweight and self-contained. However, they typically limit personalization to object recognition or captioning, overlooking the relations among personalized concepts that can be structured into a knowledge graph to support relational reasoning. In contrast, our model captures personalized concepts, their attributes and relations, thus having relational reasoning capabilities and giving contextual and accurate responses when handling personalized queries.

### 3 ReGraP Dataset: Data Generation Pipeline

We introduce a data generation pipeline that provides KGs and CoT QA pairs for model training, as shown in Figure [2.](#page-3-0) Given a set of images and textual descriptions, this pipeline extracts personalized knowledge from the raw input and explores their relations, thereby constructing a personalized knowledge graph and subsequently generating CoT QA pairs from the constructed KG.

This pipeline aims at constructing a training database D consisting of multiple independent sets. Each set S represents data of a set of personalized concepts (e.g., individuals, items...) and their attributes and relations. It contains a collection of images I of these concepts, a KG G whose nodes are the

<span id="page-3-0"></span>![](_page_3_Figure_0.jpeg)

Figure 2: The data generation pipeline. We first construct knowledge graph that represents the personalized knowledge, and then derive CoT QA pairs from the knowledge graph.

concepts and their attributes, and edges are the relations, and a set of instruction pairs P(QA,R) where each pair consists of a CoT QA pair QA and its corresponding reasoning subgraph R ⊆ G.

The images come from user-captured photos or publicly available sources on the internet, while textual knowledge Ktext originates from users' own descriptions or publicly accessible resources. Images can directly serve as the I. To this end, we focus on constructing G that fully captures both relational and attribute-based knowledge of Ktext, and subsequently utilize G to generate QA. Accordingly, the data generate pipeline is divided to two main steps.

Reasoning-based Knowledge Graph Construction. We first introduce the construction process of G which is the first step of the data generation pipeline (see Figure [2](#page-3-0) left). Personalized concepts in I) are extracted as main entities E, and Ktext is divided into relational knowledge K<sup>R</sup> and attribute knowledge KA. We prompt GPT-4o [\[29\]](#page-10-14) to serve as a Relation-Graph Builder BRG (prompts are detailed in Table [13\)](#page-18-0). The builder takes KR, E, and I as input, and outputs a set of triplets that form the relation graph G<sup>R</sup> that only contains the nodes of entities and edges of relations, formulated as:

$$
\mathcal{G}_{\mathcal{R}} = \mathcal{B}_{RG}(\mathcal{K}_{\mathcal{R}}, \mathcal{E}, \mathcal{I}) = \left\{ (h_i, r_i, t_i) \right\}_{i=1}^n, \tag{1}
$$

where each triplet (h<sup>i</sup> , r<sup>i</sup> , ti) denotes a head entity h<sup>i</sup> ∈ E, a relation r<sup>i</sup> , and a tail entity t<sup>i</sup> ∈ E, capturing the semantic connections derived from relational knowledge and image. Then, we prompt GPT-4o to serve as a KG Enricher ErKG (prompts are detailed in Table [14\)](#page-18-1), which takes G<sup>R</sup> and K<sup>A</sup> as input. The process proceeds in two steps: (1) It adds nodes Nnew representing attributes and potential new concepts to the graph. (2) It explores and adds new edges representing relations between the nodes. This process generates the personalized knowledge graph G, formulated as:

$$
\mathcal{G} = \text{Er}_{\mathcal{KG}}(\mathcal{G}_{new}, \mathcal{K}_A), \text{with } \mathcal{G}_{new} = \mathcal{G}_{\mathcal{R}} + N_{new}
$$
\n<sup>(2)</sup>

CoT QA pairs Generation. After constructing G, we proceed to generate P(QA,R) from the routes on G, which is the second step of the data generation pipeline (see Figure [2](#page-3-0) right). As the relations in G connect nodes to form step-by-step paths that collectively compose a reasoning chain, we begin by traversing the nodes and their relation paths to construct reasoning routes. In this context, the routes may share common starting nodes or be nested within longer routes. Therefore, we reorder the nodes to construct reasoning trees T , which contains more comprehensive and hierarchically structured reasoning routes. Thereafter, Depth-first search (DFS) is applied to T to extract the longest reasoning routes (subgraphs) and construct a set of reasoning routes SR, formulated as: S<sup>R</sup> = DFS(T ). These routes are subsequently used as contextual prompts to guide GPT-4o in generating questions Q, where each route R serves as the "thinking process" for answering the question. Finally, Q and R are jointly provided to GPT-4o to generate a CoT reasoning answer ACoT , formulated as:

$$
\mathcal{A}_{CoT} = \text{GPT}(\mathcal{Q}, \mathcal{R}),\tag{3}
$$

Each question and its answer form a CoT QA pair, associated with the corresponding R. These pairs jointly constitute the P(QA,R) . Prompts for QA generation are detailed in Table [15](#page-19-0) and Table [16.](#page-19-1) Section [C](#page-13-0) evaluates the quality of the generated CoT QA pairs.

### <span id="page-4-1"></span>4 ReGraP-LLaVA: Training Framework

To align knowledge graphs with MLLMs, we adopt both soft prompts in Figure [3](#page-4-0) (a) and hard prompts in Figure [3](#page-4-0) (b) to transform the graph into a format compatible with LLaVA. In addition, the CoT QA pairs can be regarded as the extraction of knowledge in the graph, also serving as a hard-prompt formulation of knowledge graphs.

<span id="page-4-0"></span>![](_page_4_Figure_5.jpeg)

Figure 3: The framework of ReGraP-LLaVA. The left side shows the framework to soft prompt graphs, and the right side shows the framework to hard prompt graphs.

#### 4.1 Soft-Prompting LLM with Graph.

This method employs a GNN module in conjunction with a projection layer, implemented as a multilayer perceptron (MLP), for encoding the subgraph into embeddings that are aligned with the vector space of the LLM. To prepare the graph for GNN processing, nodes and relations are first converted into one-hot encoded vectors, constructing a graph g, whose nodes are personalized concepts and their attributes, and edges are relations between the concepts and attributes. The graph g is firstly passed through the GNN to compute the graph embedding H<sup>g</sup> = GNN(g), which provides a representation of the personalized knowledge in the subgraph. To align the embedding with the same word embedding space of MLLM, we then apply a MLP projection layer to convert H<sup>g</sup> to Hˆ which has the same dimensionality as the word embedding space in the language model, formulated as:

$$
\hat{\mathcal{H}} = \text{MLP}(\mathcal{H}_g) \in \mathbb{R}^d, \text{with } H_g = \text{GNN}(g)
$$
\n<sup>(4)</sup>

where d is the hidden dimension of the LLM. Hˆ is then used as a soft prompt in conjunction with embeddings derived from visual and textual inputs.

We proceed to process the textual and visional information associated with the subgraph. Specifically, the Q of the CoT QA pairs provide the language instruction, and the ACoT serve as the Language Responses. In this framework, the vision encoder, vision projector, and tokenizer of the pre-trained LLaVA are frozen to preserve their original capabilities. The Q is first tokenized by the LLM's tokenizer into a sequence of discrete tokens {tokeni} m <sup>i</sup>=1, where m denotes the sequence length. Subsequently, these tokens are embedded into a continuous vector space, formulated as:

$$
\mathbf{X}_{\text{emb}} = \text{Embed}(\{\text{token}_i\}_{i=1}^m) \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times d},\tag{5}
$$

Next, Xemb is concatenated with the graph embeddings Hˆ to form the new instruction embedding token sequence Xnew i , denoted as Xnew <sup>i</sup> <sup>=</sup> <sup>X</sup>emb <sup>+</sup> <sup>H</sup>ˆ. Following the original LLaVA architecture, Xnew i is concatenated with the visual embedding tokens encoded from the image input via the vision encoder and projector, and the sequence is processed following the original LLaVA training pipeline.

#### 4.2 Hard-Prompting LLM with Graph.

While embedding a graph directly into vector representations aligns it with word embedding space, knowledge in a graph can also be represented by natural language, which may serve as a more learnable and interpretable prompt for MLLMs. Inspired by recent studies [\[5,](#page-9-4) [7\]](#page-9-6) that learnable tokens can efficiently capture personalized concepts, we introduce new *reasoning tokens* to represent personalized knowledge. These tokens enable the subgraph to be expressed as a prompt sequence that integrates the newly added tokens, thereby allowing the model to learn the reasoning processes.

Specifically, a subgraph can be represented as a collection of continuous relational triples, formulated as g = {(E<sup>i</sup> , r<sup>i</sup> , Ei+1)} N <sup>i</sup>=1, where each triple consists of a head entity E<sup>i</sup> , a relation r<sup>i</sup> , and a tail entity Ei+1. Here, E<sup>i</sup> denotes personalized concepts and their attributes, r<sup>i</sup> denotes relations, and N denotes the total number of relations in the subgraph. The triples are sequentially connected. For entities, we utilize their names as the new-added *entity tokens* and {<Relationi>} N <sup>i</sup>=1 as the new-added *relation tokens*. Hereby, the prompt to describe the graph is: "<E1> *and* <E2> *share a* <Relation1>*,...,*<E<sup>N</sup> > *and* <EN+1> *share a* <Relation<sup>N</sup> >. <E1> *is <desc.>,...,*<Relation1> *is <desc.>....*" Here, E<sup>i</sup> are the names of the entities, and *<desc.>* represents a short natural language description. Given a graph, there are N *relation tokens* and N + 1 *entity tokens*, collectively referred to as *reasoning tokens*, which are learned to embed structural information of the graph. These reasoning tokens are introduced as new entries to the tokenizer, effectively transforming it into a reasoning tokenizer. Subsequently, the final classification head matrix Wc×<sup>n</sup> of the language model is expanded by 2N + 1, resulting in an updated matrix Wc×(n+2N+1), to accommodate the additional vocabulary introduced by reasoning tokens. Thus, the new trainable parameters are:

$$
\boldsymbol{\theta}_{new} = \{ \langle E_1 \rangle, \ldots, \langle E_{N+1} \rangle, \langle Relation_1 \rangle, \ldots, \langle Relation_N \rangle, W_{(:,n+2N+1)} \}.
$$

The Q of the CoT QA pairs and the graph prompt X<sup>g</sup> are concatenated to form new instruction input X<sup>i</sup> , together with ACoT and the associated image input I, constituting the training data triplets (X<sup>i</sup> , I, Xa) of LLaVA. We apply the standard language loss of LLaVA to compute the probability of the target answers X<sup>a</sup> for each conversation of length L:

$$
p(\mathbf{X}_{a} | \mathbf{I}, \mathbf{X}_{i}) = \prod_{j=1}^{L} p_{\theta}(x_{j} | \mathbf{I}, \mathbf{X}_{i, < j}, \mathbf{X}_{a, < j}), \tag{6}
$$

where θ denotes the trainable parameters of the model, and Xi<j and Xa<j represent the instruction and answer tokens from all previous turns prior to the current prediction token x<sup>j</sup> , respectively.

Table 1: Comparison between MyVLM [\[9\]](#page-9-8), Yo'LLaVA [\[5\]](#page-9-4) and ReGraP datasets. # Avg. is the average number of objects in multi-object sets. Len. is the average number of steps in the QA pairs.

Training. We have 10 training images and around 20 CoT QA pairs for one set of personalized knowledge. We use LoRA [\[30\]](#page-10-15) and AdamW [\[31\]](#page-10-16) with a learning rate of 1e-5 and LLaVA-v1.6 vicuna-7b [\[32\]](#page-11-0) as the base model. We train each set for up to 10 epochs on single NVIDIA A6000.

Dataset. As illustrated in Table [1,](#page-5-0) building on the Yo'LLaVA [\[5\]](#page-9-4) dataset, we construct 80 additional personalized knowledge sets: 40 single-object, 20 five-object and 20 six-object, bringing the total to 120 sets. Each image in the multi-object sets contain all personalized concepts of the corresponding set. Even in single-object sets, surrounding objects in images and textual knowledge provide supplementary entities that help construct the knowledge graph. Each set contains approximately 10 training and 10 testing images, totally around 20 images per set. Additionally, each set contains an entire graph, over 20 CoT QA pairs and the corresponding subgraph.

Baselines. For finetuning-based baselines, we select Yo'LLaVA [\[5\]](#page-9-4) and Vicuna LLaVA-7B [\[32\]](#page-11-0) with LoRA finetuning as our main comparison models. Both are trained on raw personalized knowledge (images and the raw textual knowledge from internet and human) and CoT QA pairs in ReGraP dataset separately, to demonstrate the effectiveness of both our ReGraP dataset and training framework.

For prompt-based baselines, we evaluate 7B models including Vicuna LLaVA [\[32\]](#page-11-0), Qwen-2-VL [\[33\]](#page-11-1) and Qwen2.5-VL [\[34\]](#page-11-2), 13B model LLaVA-1.5-13B [\[35\]](#page-11-3) and leading models Qwen2.5-VL-72B [\[36\]](#page-11-4) and GPT-4o [\[29\]](#page-10-14) (GPT-4o is only evaluated in the close-ended evaluation, as the openended evaluation leverages GPT-4o as an evaluator). We prompt these models with descriptions of personalized knowledge in the images, and avoid the leakage of direct answers.

Benchmark. For each set of personalized knowledge, we construct a diverse set of closed-ended questions, containing 40 multiple-choice questions (20 basic, 20 requiring reasoning), 15 true-orfalse questions (5 basic, 10 requiring reasoning), 10 fill-in-the-blank questions (5 basic, 5 requiring reasoning), and 3 descriptive questions (1 for basic captioning, 2 requiring reasoning). We then generate 5 open-ended descriptive QA questions (requiring reasoning) and one open-ended task asking models to generate a comprehensive description of the image.

### 6 Results

We demonstrate the effectiveness of the ReGraP dataset and ReGraP-LLaVA across close-ended question-answering in Section [6.1](#page-6-0) and open-ended question-answering in Section [6.2.](#page-7-0) These tasks evaluate models' ability to recognize personalized concepts, learn their attributes and relations, and reason over these knowledge in both constrained and free-form settings. Section [6.3](#page-7-1) compares the performance between different methods of graph-prompting. Section [6.4](#page-8-0) shows qualitative examples of models' answers. Section [A](#page-12-0) provides additional ablation studies, section [B](#page-12-1) evaluates the alignment of models' responses with human's preference, and section [I](#page-15-0) discuss possible errors and deviations.

Table 2: Comparison of ReGraP-LLaVA with prompt- and finetuning-based models on closed-ended QA tasks. The questions examining basic knowledge (e.g. features, recognition) are denoted as "Simple" and those requiring relational and multi-step reasoning are denoted as "Difficult".

#### <span id="page-6-0"></span>6.1 Close-ended QA

We feed raw personalized knowledge and CoT QA pairs in the ReGraP dataset separately to train both Yo'LLaVA and LLaVA, referred as Yo'LLaVA (Raw), Yo'LLaVA (CoT), LLaVA (Raw), and LLaVA (CoT), serving as finetuning-based models. For prompt-based models, we construct descriptions of personalized concepts in images using GPT-4o (prompts are detailed in Table [17\)](#page-19-2), and manually verify that no direct answer leakage. These descriptions are then used to prompt the models.

Table [2](#page-6-1) presents the accuracy results for each task across all evaluated models. ReGraP-LLaVA outperforms all baselines across most tasks, with the exception of simple descriptive QA, where LLaVA-13B (Prompt) achieves the highest accuracy of 1.000, followed by ours with a close third at 0.975. Moreover, LLaVA (CoT), trained on CoT QA pairs of ReGraP dataset, ranks second in 5 out of 8 task types, further demonstrating that training models with our data can improve the performance. Numerically, our model achieves a large weighted improvement of 5.3% comparing to the best finetuning-based model, LLaVA (CoT), and 8.8% comparing to the best prompt-based model, GPT-4o (Prompt). In contrast, Yo'LLaVA, with its low computational overhead, performs well on simple tasks (e.g., basic recognition) but fails to capture complicated relational knowledge and reasoning processes due to limited learnable parameters.

To validate generalization beyond our own benchmark, we evaluate our model with Yo'LLaVA and MyVLM [\[9\]](#page-9-8) on using their datasets under identical settings. We prompt models with "Can you see *<concept name>* in this image?" for recognition tasks and "Caption this image in a short sentence." for captioning tasks. For captioning tasks, a response is considered correct if it includes the personalized concept and its meaning aligns with the content of the image. The evaluation includes both positive (concept-present) and negative (concept-absent) samples, where for negative samples, the correct answer is expected to be a denial (e.g., "no"). Table [3](#page-7-2) shows the results. ReGraP-LLaVA showcases clear advantages in both positive tasks and comparable accuracy in negative tasks. The slightly lower accuracy in the negative recognition task may caused by few negative or counterfactual examples in training data, which makes our model more challenging to say "no" confidently.

#### <span id="page-7-0"></span>6.2 Open-ended QA

We conduct experiments on open-ended descriptive tasks with 2 evaluation metrics. For each question, we construct 3 to 5 key points and assess whether models' responses cover them by both GPT-4o and human judges, and the resulting score, denoted as Point in Table [4,](#page-7-2) is computed by the number of matched points divided by the number of total points. Then, we employ GPT-4o with personalized knowledge and images to generate reference answers and subsequently perform as an evaluator to score model outputs based on the reference (prompts are detailed in Table [18](#page-20-0) and Table [19\)](#page-20-1).

Table [4](#page-7-2) shows the results. Our model achieves the best performance in 3 out of 4 open-ended tasks and attains the highest scores in the Point metric for both tasks. For GPT-score on the full description task, ReGraP-LLaVA ranks a close second behind LLaVA-13B (Prompt). Notably, the Point metric offers the most substantive and quantitative assessment of the performance, while the GPT-Score serve as a reference, which reflects the alignment with GPT's styles and preferences rather than an absolute measure of answer quality. In this scenario, prompt-based methods receive GPT-generated descriptions as direct inputs, which influences their output style and may contribute to higher scores.

### <span id="page-7-1"></span>6.3 Ablation Study

In this section, we examine how the two proposed graph-prompting methods in section [4](#page-4-1) influence model performance. We assess hard- and soft-prompt methods individually and also in combination to learn both respective and joint effects, and select the close-ended QA as the metric. Table [5](#page-7-3) showcases the result. Overall, the single hard-prompt method achieves the highest accuracy, yielding 16 more correct answers than the combination method and 28 more than the single soft-prompt method out of 8160 questions. The slight accuracy difference across these methods (less than 0.4%) demonstrates the feasibility of all methods. Due to the marginal advantage of the hard-prompt method, we adopt it as the main method in other experiments. Notably, LLaVA (CoT) serves as an ablated variant of ReGraP-LLaVA without the graph-prompting module, and the performance gains over it in Sections [6.1](#page-6-0) and [6.2](#page-7-0) prove the effectiveness of graph-promptings. Besides, we conduct additional ablation studies on the number of objects and length of CoT QA pairs, which are detailed in section [A.](#page-12-0)

Table 6: Qualitative comparison with other methods. We use green to denote correct and expected contents, blue to denote irrelevant or unexpected contents, and red to denote wrong contents. Attention visualizations of ReGraP-LLaVA further demonstrate that the model grounds its reasoning on learned personalized knowledge, focusing on regions related to task-specific question answering.

### <span id="page-8-0"></span>6.4 Case Study

In Table [6,](#page-8-1) we showcase qualitative examples of model outputs across different query types. We compare our method with representative baselines: Yo'LLaVA (CoT), LLaVA (CoT), and LLaVA-13B (Prompt). All approaches succeed in basic recognition tasks. However, Yo'LLaVA sometimes fails to leverage the relations between personalized concepts, resulting in incorrect or overly generic responses rather than contextual answers in personalized scenarios. LLaVA (CoT) provides answers with high accuracy, while the reasoning process is occasionally unexpected or even incorrect, and it sometimes includes irrelevant information in its responses. LLaVA-13B (Prompt) exhibits similar drawbacks with LLaVA (CoT), and its performance is impacted by misinterpretations brought by lowquality prompts. In contrast, ReGraP-LLaVA shows consistency in providing correct and contextual responses, and the detailed answers illustrate the model's capability to utilize relational knowledge effectively. The visualization of attentions of ReGraP-LLaVA further demonstrates its capability to recognize and focus on task-related objects (regions) and to reason over the learned knowledge. More qualitative examples of ReGraP-LLaVA's question-answering are detailed in section [H.](#page-15-1)

### 7 Conclusion

In this work, we leverage knowledge graphs and CoT QA pairs to enhance the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs in the context of personalization. We introduce ReGraP dataset and a novel MLLM, ReGraP- LLaVA, which is trained on images, CoT QA pairs and soft and/or hard prompts of knowledge graphs. We investigate the feasibility of both soft and hard prompts for training LLMs, and establish the ReGraP benchmark to evaluate models' relational reasoning and knowledge connection capability on personalized knowledge. Experimental results show that ReGraP-LLaVA effectively learns personalized knowledge and utilize it in reasoning for accurate and contextual answers, which demonstrates the effectiveness of both our dataset and methods. Future works can explore more effective methods for aligning knowledge graphs with MLLMs, and strategies to reduce computational overhead while preserving strong reasoning capabilities for personalization.

### <span id="page-12-0"></span>A Additional Ablation Studies

Number of personalized objects in a set. We investigate how the number of personalized objects in a set influences model performance. To this end, we construct 2-, 3-, and 4-object sets by reducing the number of personalized concepts from multi-object sets, and remove the corresponding knowledge from both the KGs and the CoT QA pairs. We then conduct experiments on close-ended questions, selecting those pertaining to the remaining objects. Figure [4](#page-12-2) showcases the results. Overall, the accuracy remains consistent across different object settings, which suggests that the number of objects has a limited impact on model performance. The key reason lies in our method: regardless of the number of objects, we construct KGs and CoT QA pairs by fully utilizing attributes and relations of each object. This ensures the model receives complete knowledge.

Length of CoT answers in CoT QA pairs. We investigate how the length of answers in CoT QA pairs influences model performance. To this end, we refine the long answers by reducing the reasoning steps. We then conduct experiments on close-ended questions. Figure [5](#page-12-3) showcases the results. Overall, the accuracy on simple tasks remains largely unaffected by the reduced answer length. However, for difficult tasks that require multi-step reasoning and relational inference, performance improves as the length of the answers increases. This indicates that longer CoT answers play a critical role in supporting the model's reasoning capability for challenging queries, while providing fewer benefits for basic recognition and knowledge acquisition.

### <span id="page-12-1"></span>B Human Evaluation

We investigate how ReGraP-LLaVA aligns with human's preference. Inspired by LIMA [\[37\]](#page-11-5), we adopt two human evaluation metrics: (1) Given a set of personalized knowledge, a question and two responses from ReGraP-LLaVA and a baseline respectively, we ask human annotators to judge if "response 1 is better" (ReGraP-LLaVA wins), "cannot tell difference" (Tie) or "response 2 is better" (Baseline wins). (2) Given a set of personalized knowledge and two MLLMs, we ask human annotators to ask questions to the models respectively, and tell if "model 1 is better" (ReGraP-LLaVA wins), "cannot tell difference" (Tie) or "model 2 is better" (Baseline wins). Figure [6](#page-13-1) (a) shows the results of the first metric and Figure [6](#page-13-1) (b) shows the results of the second metric. The results demonstrate that our model gives responses aligning with human's preference better.

### <span id="page-13-0"></span>C Evaluation on the quality of CoT QA pairs

In this section, we evaluate the quality of the CoT QA pairs using both human annotators and LLMs. The evaluation is conducted across four questions: (1) *Does the answer address the question*, (2) *"Is the reasoning correct in logic?"*, (3) *Does the answer demonstrate step-by-step reasoning that leads to the correct conclusion*, and (4) *Is the overall quality of the response satisfactory*, which are denoted as "accuracy", "logic", "reason" and "quality" separately. For the evaluation, we randomly sample 200 CoT QA pairs, each of which is independently assessed across the above criteria. Evaluators are instructed to provide binary judgments (*Yes* or *No*) for each question. The LLMs employed for evaluation include GPT-4o-2024-11-20, Qwen-Max-2025-01-25, Grok-3, and Deepseek-R1. Table [7](#page-13-2) presents the evaluation results. Notably, all LLMs except GPT-4o consistently response "Yes" across all questions, reflecting a strong alignment with their preferences. For the "reason" criterion, GPT-4o occasionally provides a "No" judgment, and it explains that these answers reveal the conclusion at the start rather than arriving at it after step-by-step reasoning. The same reason also appears in other evaluations and leads to an assignment of "No". Nevertheless, both GPT-4o and humans acknowledge the overall quality of these QA pairs, suggesting that this judgment pertains to the formats rather than a deficiency in its content or correctness. Table [8](#page-13-3) shows the qualitative example of this case.

<span id="page-13-2"></span>

| Evaluator           | Accuracy (Yes%) | Logic (Yes%) | Reason (Yes%) | Quality (Yes%) |

### D Additional Related Work

Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Multimodal tasks. MM-CoT [\[38\]](#page-11-6) studies the CoT reasoning in different modalities, and proposes a two-stage framework to perform Multimodal-CoT. The model first generates rationales and subsequently inference final answers. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this multi-step reasoning process in vision-related tasks.

CCoT [\[39\]](#page-11-7) proposes a zero-shot CoT approach that utilizes scene graphs to extract compositional knowledge out of an MLLM. The model is first instructed to construct a scene graph containing the objects, their attributes, and the relations in an image. Thereafter, the scene graph is converted into text, and included in a follow-up prompt jointly with the original question to produce the final answer. Experimental results demonstrate the performance gain brought by the graph-prompting.

Visual CoT [\[40\]](#page-11-8) introduces a visual CoT dataset and a multi-turn inference pipeline for MLLMs. The model first attends to highlighted regions and generates an interpretable thought, then progressively improves its answer. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on the improvement of the model's visual understanding ability.

Integrating Knowledge Graphs in MLLMs. KAM-CoT [\[41\]](#page-11-9) proposes the Knowledge Augmented Multimodal CoT approach, KAM-CoT, which injects knowledge graphs into the reasoning process of models. Experimental results demonstrate that the incorporation of KG in the two-stage training process helps reduce hallucination and provide accurate answers.

GraphVis [\[42\]](#page-11-10) proposes a method to convert KGs into visual promptings in order to instruct the model to learn knowledge in an image thoroughly. This method enhances LLMs' ability to learn and reason over KG data to enhance the textual QA responding. Experimental results demonstrate notable accuracy gains on knowledge-intensive visual QA tasks.

### E Hyperparameters and Prompts

In this section, we present the hyperparameters to train the model. Table [9](#page-14-0) showcases the details. We also present the prompts in knowledge graph construction (Table [13,](#page-18-0) Table [14,](#page-18-1) Table [15,](#page-19-0) Table [16\)](#page-19-1) and in performance evaluation (Table [17,](#page-19-2) Table [18,](#page-20-0) Table [19\)](#page-20-1). Specifically, the GPT version in this work is GPT-4o-2024-11-20. All responses are manually reviewed, and necessary adjustments (e.g., formatting in data generation stage, few-shot correction for description generation) are applied to ensure data quality and robustness in both generation and performance assessment stages.

### F Training Data Examples

In this section, we present representative examples of the training data, which include images, the procedures for constructing KGs, and corresponding examples of CoT QA pairs. Table [20,](#page-21-0) Table [21,](#page-22-0) and Table [22](#page-23-0) illustrate examples from single-object sets, where we focus on a single object and leverage its attributes and components to construct the knowledge graph. Table [23,](#page-24-0) Table [24,](#page-25-0) and Table [25](#page-26-0) illustrate examples from multi-object sets, where multiple objects or characters, along with their attributes and relations, are integrated to build the knowledge graph.

### G Benchmark Examples

In this section, we present representative examples of our benchmark, which include Multiple-Choice, Fill-in-the-blank, True/False, and Descriptive questions. Table [10](#page-15-2) presents a comparison between our benchmark and the Yo'LLaVA benchmark. We establish questions that not only assess basic recognition and captioning abilities, but also emphasize understanding of relations among multiple personalized concepts and utilize the learned knowledge in answering. Table [26,](#page-27-0) Table [27,](#page-28-0) Table [28,](#page-29-0) Table [29,](#page-30-0) Table [30,](#page-31-0) and Table [31](#page-32-0) showcase the different types of answers and reference answers in detail. The benchmark encompasses both simple questions focused on attribute learning or recognition and more complex questions that require reasoning over relations and detailed image understanding.

Table 10: Comparison of benchmark designs between Yo'LLaVA and ReGraP.

# <span id="page-15-1"></span>H Qualitative Results

In this section, we present qualitative examples that showcase ReGraP-LLaVA's question-answering capabilities. Table [32,](#page-33-0) Table [33,](#page-34-0) Table [34,](#page-35-0) Table [35,](#page-36-0) Table [36,](#page-37-0) and Table [37](#page-38-0) provide the questions and model's answers in detail. The responses demonstrate that ReGraP-LLaVA effectively learns personalized knowledge and accurately utilizes it to handle user queries across different types of questions. The model is able to provide detailed analyses of images and leverage the corresponding learned knowledge to generate contextually appropriate and comprehensive answers.

### <span id="page-15-0"></span>I Discussion on errors and deviations

Due to the inherent stochasticity in both the training and inference processes of MLLMs, we conduct a robustness analysis to evaluate the stability and reliability of our results. The main concern is whether repeated training runs with the same data and experimental settings introduce variability in the model's outputs. We select five personalized knowledge sets and train five models independently from scratch for each set. Subsequently, we prompt each model with the same image and a query corresponding to its associated personalized concept: "Give a short description on <*concept name*> in this image.". We assess whether generated outputs exhibit semantic consistency across models trained on the same training set. Encouragingly, the outputs remain semantically consistent across models, confirming the robustness of our training pipeline. Table [11](#page-16-0) presents qualitative examples.

Another main concern is the reproducibility of the model's outputs. For each model trained on a distinct personalized knowledge set, we prompt it 10 times with the same image and a query corresponding to its associated personalized concept: "Give a short description on <*concept name*> in this image.". We examine whether the generated responses remain semantically consistent across runs. Encouragingly, all outputs are consistent in content, with the vast majority being totally identical, which demonstrates the strong robustness in the inference process.

<span id="page-16-0"></span>![](_page_16_Picture_2.jpeg)

Table 11: Qualitative example of deviations. The responses remain consistent.

# J Limitations.

ReGraP-LLaVA is not without limitations. First, due to the inherent hallucination in language models, it may occasionally generate fabricated information about the image or the queried entities (e.g., inventing features that do not exist). Second, ReGraP-LLaVA sometimes produces overly detailed responses to simple queries. While this may improve answers' accuracy, it can reduce computational efficiency and potentially diverge from human preferences, leading to responses that are less aligned with practical expectations. Table [12](#page-17-0) showcases a qualitative example of an overly detailed answer.

Q: "What is the relation between the mouse and the monitor?",

A:Good cable management helps reduce visual clutter, making the workspace cleaner and more organized. Properly routing cables also prevents accidental disconnections and protects devices from strain or damage.

Her encounter with Momoka Kawaragi, a former member of the band Diamond Dust, reignited her passion for music and led to the formation of a temporary band, Shin-Kawasaki, alongside Subaru Awa. Nina's determination and emotional authenticity attracted other members, including Rupa and Tomo, culminating in the establishment of Togenashi Togeari. Throughout the series, Nina confronts her past traumas, reconciles with her family, and matures both personally and musically. Her journey from isolation to connection not only shapes the band's emotional and musical direction but also fosters a sense of unity and purpose among its members, solidifying Togenashi Togeari's identity and resonance with their audience.

| ReGraP-LLaVA: | From the image, I can see that: 1. The calendar has movable blocks with the date.<br>This is visible as the number '22' is currently placed on the date block. 2. The<br>character has an anime-style design, which is often seen in a more three-dimensional<br>format. This gives the item a dynamic appearance. 3. The character is an anime girl<br>with yellow hair, which is an element of the calendar's aesthetic. 4. The calendar has<br>Chinese characters, which are written in the traditional script. This adds an cultural<br>element to the item. 5. The calendar is placed on a desk, which is a setting where its<br>use is visible. This gives context to the item's role as a date-keeping device. These<br>elements combine to create a visual record of the item's use. <anime_calendar><br/>is visible: the character's anime style, the movable date blocks, and the setting<br/>on the desk. These elements combine to show the role of the calendar. Thus,<br/><anime_calendar> is visible in the photo. The calendar is interactive, as shown<br/>by the number '22' being placed on the date block. This is clear from the photo,<br/>where the number is currently on the date block. The character's anime style is<br/>also interactive, as it can be moved around the calendar. Thus, both interaction and<br/>visual record are preserved in the photo. Thus, <anime_calendar> is interactive, as<br/>shown by the number being on the date block and the character's anime style being<br/>interactive. The calendar has both visual and functional elements: the character's<br/>anime style, the movable date blocks, and the Chinese characters. These elements<br/>combine to create a calendar that is both a piece of art and a functional date-keeper.<br/>Thus, both visual and functional elements are present in the calendar.</anime_calendar></anime_calendar></anime_calendar> |

| ReGraP-LLaVA: | The calendar has a vivid and playful design, featuring an anime character with<br>yellow hair on the top section.

| ReGraP-LLaVA: | The setup has wired Asus ROG laptop with a wired Philips monitor, a wired<br>Filco keyboard, a wireless Asus ROG mouse and a wireless Bose headphone.<br>Although these devices have a stable connection, they are limited by physical<br>cables, suggesting a need for convenience over portability. The setup is positioned<br>near a window with a city view, which might expose the setup to direct sunlight<br>and temperature changes, requiring regular adjustment. Lastly, the computer mouse<br>and Bose headphones are Bluetooth, suggesting a trade-off between convenience<br>and battery life.Overall, the spatial arrangement and device choices illustrate a<br>thoughtful integration of human comfort, functional reliability, and situational<br>adaptability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |  |  |

| ReGraP-LLaVA:   | Bocchi is seen in the second left of the picture. She is a student at School A, in a<br>lower grade, and plays the guitar in Kessoku Band. Her position in the picture is in<br>the middle, and she is positioned between Nijika and Kita. Bocchi has pink hair<br>and is shy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |  |

| ReGraP-LLaVA:   | When Bocchi is in trouble, Kita can help. Kita has a good understanding of Bocchi's<br>struggles and can give her direction and advice on how to overcome them. As<br>her schoolmate, Kita has more experience and is better positioned to guide her.<br>Additionally, Kita is an outgoing girl and bandmate, which means she can offer<br>valuable advice on improving Bocchi's communication skills and confidence as<br>a musician. Since Kita understands the challenges of being a beginner, she can<br>share her own experiences, challenges, and tips to help Bocchi grow as a musician<br>and overcome any difficulties she may face. Additionally, Nijika can also provide<br>help and guidance to Bocchi when she needs it. Nijika has experience dealing with<br>issues related to school and music, and is the leader of the Kessoku band. She can<br>share her knowledge and experience to help Bocchi improve her confidence and<br>overcome her challenges. |  |
| Question:       | Kita is missing, who may go to find her?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |  |
| ReGraP-LLaVA:   | Kita is missing, it is likely that Nijika would take the initiative to find her. Nijika, as<br>the leader and the most proactive member of Kessoku Band, often acts as the glue<br>that keeps the group together. Her kind and supportive nature makes her attentive<br>to the well-being of her friends, and she would naturally step up in moments<br>of uncertainty.<br>While Bocchi deeply cares about her bandmates, her extreme<br>social anxiety might hinder her ability to act immediately in a high-stress situation.<br>Instead, Bocchi would likely express concern and worry internally but would rely on<br>Nijika's leadership to take action. This dynamic highlights the balance of emotional<br>bonds and complementary roles within Kessoku Band, where Nijika often provides<br>stability and initiative while Bocchi offers silent, heartfelt support.                                                                                                |  |

| ReGraP-LLaVA:   | Ryo is upset because she is unsure if she has a future as a musician. She feels<br>insecure about her skill and the potential for her to repeat the failure in her first<br>band. Nijika helps her by telling her to believe in herself and not give up. Nijika<br>also plays a key role in encouraging Ryo to face her fears and improve her skills,<br>which helps her become more confident in her future as a musician. Additionally,<br>Ryo may be lack of money. Since Bocchi has lent her money multiple times, Ryo<br>can once again borrow from her. Bocchi is a kind and supportive person, so she<br>would help when Ryo needs it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |  |
