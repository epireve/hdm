# 1 Introduction

Large-scale scientific computing software is crucial in various scientific fields, undergoing extensive development cycles that lead to the formation of intricate software libraries and ecosystems. This complexity stems from the lengthy development periods, ongoing extensions, and evolving development paradigms, making it imperative to provide users with insights into these computing tools. However, understanding such software is a challenging task due to several factors. First, large-scale scientific software often incorporates multiple programming languages, including older languages such as Fortran and Pascal, which poses a significant challenge for contemporary programmers trying to understand the code. Second, the large volume of scientific software, which may encompass millions of lines of code, presents the obstacle to comprehensively understanding each segment of the

code. Lastly, the documentation for these software systems is sometimes less than ideal, often lacking detailed explanations, which further complicates the task of gaining a thorough understanding of the software.

To enhance comprehension of large-scale scientific software, numerous tools have been devised to aid in code analysis and documentation. For instance, Doxygen [\[2\]](#page-12-0) is capable of generating documentation and performing static code analysis for software source trees. Similarly, Sphinx [\[8\]](#page-12-1) is compatible with a wide range of programming languages, making it especially effective for producing exhaustive documentation across various formats, including HTML, LaTeX (for printable PDF versions), ePub, Texinfo, manual pages, and plain text. Nonetheless, the currently available tools are primarily tailored for static code analysis and lack the capability to accommodate dynamic queries. Moreover, given the complexity inherent in large-scale scientific software, it poses a significant challenge for both developers and users to formulate queries in both instructed (e.g., textural documents) and structured formats (e.g., SQL). Thus, it is imperative to devise methods for understanding and parsing large-scale scientific software that are both user-friendly and precise.

The emergence of generative AI, particularly large language models (LLMs), heralds a new era in software comprehension and interaction. LLMs have shown remarkable capabilities across various tasks, including chatbot interactions [\[31](#page-13-0)[,10,](#page-12-2)[15\]](#page-12-3), text summarization [\[25,](#page-13-1)[12,](#page-12-4)[29\]](#page-13-2), and content creation [\[9,](#page-12-5)[17](#page-12-6)[,18\]](#page-12-7), demonstrating their potential to revolutionize programming and documentation practices. Beyond these applications, LLMs offer promising solutions for navigating and understanding the complex landscapes of large-scale scientific software [\[24\]](#page-13-3). By leveraging LLMs, we can envision a future where software comprehension is not only more accessible but also more intuitive, enabling users to query and interact with software in natural language. This paper introduces S3LLM , a novel framework that embodies this vision, providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with complex scientific computing software through conversational, natural language queries. S3LLM aims to bridge the gap between the intricate world of scientific software and the diverse community of users and developers, fostering a deeper understanding and facilitating more effective use of these critical computational tools.

Different from most existing works on software understanding, the proposed S3LLM can handle various types of tasks for large-scale scientific software understanding including source code query, metadata analysis, and text-based technical report understanding. S3LLM is capable of conducting queries over the information extracted from source code in diverse formats, such as DOT (graph description language)[5](#page-1-0) and relational database. By leveraging the few-shot learning capability of LLMs, S3LLM can also generate domain-specific language (DSL) queries, such as Feature Query Language (FQL) [\[33\]](#page-13-4), to gather and extract software features through code analysis. Furthermore, S3LLM implements LangChain and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) [\[20\]](#page-13-5) schemes to enable text-based queries from technical reports and project summaries. More importantly, all aforementioned interactions and inquiries facilitated by S3LLM are executed utilizing natural language.

The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:

â€“ We have conceptualized, designed, and implemented S3LLM , a novel framework that utilizes LLMs to improve the understanding of large-scale scientific software. This framework excels in analyzing source code, metadata, and textual technical reports, providing a holistic approach to software comprehension.

# 2 Related Work

Code information collection: A variety of tools have been developed to gather diverse forms of code information. Tools such as cloc [\[1\]](#page-12-9), sloc [\[6\]](#page-12-10), and sonar [\[7\]](#page-12-11) are designed to assess a project's source code to determine its size and the programming languages employed. Meanwhile, the ScanCode [\[5\]](#page-12-12) toolkit and fossology [\[3\]](#page-12-13) are specialized tools that provide insights on software licenses, copyrights, dependencies, and additional relevant information. The OSS Review Toolkit [\[4\]](#page-12-14) further enhances these capabilities by integrating third-party package managers (e.g., MAVEN, PIP, NPM) and code scanners (e.g., Licensee, ScanCode), facilitating the identification of dependencies across different open-source libraries within a project. Nonetheless, these tools do not leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI) or LLMs to simplify the process of collecting code information, which requires users to input their requirements in a format that these tools can interpret. In contrast, our framework S3LLM distinguishes itself by allowing users to express their requirements in natural language, subsequently providing precise and accurate code information. This approach significantly improves the efficiency and accuracy of code analysis.

LLM-based Software Engineering: The integration of AI and LLMs has significantly transformed code analysis and software development methodologies. This evolution is evident in the widespread application of LLMs for code generation, underscoring their utility in enhancing programming efficiency and accuracy [\[14,](#page-12-15)[13\]](#page-12-16). Furthermore, research in this domain has validated the effectiveness of LLMs in critical tasks such as unit test generation [\[28,](#page-13-6)[26\]](#page-13-7), bug analysis [\[23,](#page-13-8)[30\]](#page-13-9), and debugging [\[11,](#page-12-17)[19\]](#page-13-10), showcasing their potential to refine testing processes, improve bug detection, and streamline debugging. Recently, researchers have also applied LLM to large-scale scientific software [\[24\]](#page-13-3). However, instead of employing LLM to understand the scientific code, researchers typically focus on specific tasks such as extracting variables of interest by reading the code documentation [\[24\]](#page-13-3). Despite the prevalent focus on code generation, testing, and repair, S3LLM diverges by leveraging both LLM and traditional techniques to deepen the understanding of large-scale scientific codes.

# 3 Method

We first introduce an overview of the S3LLM framework, subsequently delving into the detailed design of its components. S3LLM examines large-scale scientific software from multifaceted perspectives, utilizing diverse data types such as source code, code metadata, and textual reports. Each

Fig. 1: Framework overview of S3LLM

component's design is meticulously outlined to elucidate how S3LLM facilitates a comprehensive investigation of scientific software, ensuring a thorough understanding of its complex ecosystem.

## 3.1 Framework Overview

At the heart of S3LLM lies open-source LLaMA-2 models engineered for conversational interactions in natural language. LLaMA-2 has been intricately configured to support multi-round conversations, maintaining awareness of the ongoing context to ensure continuity and relevance in its responses, thus embodying in-context learning capabilities. As depicted in Figure [1,](#page-3-0) S3LLM is architecturally composed of three primary components dedicated to processing source code, code metadata, and textual technical documents. For all of the three components, LLaMA-2 models play a key role in translating natural languages into desired domain-specific language (DSL) queries or in text information analysis and retrieval. In addition, some consisting components in S3LLM adopt RAG, a methodology designed to enhance the responses of an LLM by consulting an external and authoritative knowledge base not included within its initial training data, thereby refining its output prior to generating a response. The choice of open-source LLaMA-2 models (7B, 13B, and 70B) as the foundation for all language understanding tasks within S3LLM is strategic, offering versatility in model sizes and ensuring a high degree of reproducibility across various computational environments.

## 3.2 Source Code Analysis

Large-scale scientific software, such as E3SM, often contains vast quantities of source code, exceeding a million lines in some cases. This presents a significant challenge for open-source LLMs in directly managing such a huge number of tokens by loading all of the tokens into their context windows. Furthermore, many sophisticated source code analysis tools today require users to possess in-depth

programming expertise or specialized domain knowledge for effective source code interrogation. To address these issues, S3LLM combines the code analysis capability of existing tools and the natural language understanding capability of LLMs together, not only avoiding loading the entire codebase into LLMs but also allowing users to query source code using natural language.

In illustrating the strategy of S3LLM for LLM-based source code analysis, we highlight XScan [\[32\]](#page-13-11) as a representative backend engine. XScan is an integrated software toolkit designed to extract key information of large-scale scientific code, such as lines of code, programming languages, external library dependencies, and architecture-dependent parallel software features. While XScan provides user-friendly methodologies for basic source code analysis tasks (e.g., adopting Doxygen to construct caller-callee graphs or using CLOC [\[1\]](#page-12-9) to tally lines of code), it also introduces FQL for more nuanced static code analysis. Despite XScan offering straightforward solutions for basic analysis through simple command executions, FQL's reliance on user-generated queries to investigate software features represents a significant hurdle. As Table [1](#page-4-0) demonstrates, FQL accommodates various query types, including Library Utilization, Version Assessment, and Feature Enumeration Queries, all of which demand a degree of coding proficiency from the user for precise query formulation. S3LLM is specifically designed to bridge this gap, addressing the critical challenge of facilitating accessible source code analysis without requiring extensive programming knowledge. It is important to highlight that the core LLMs powering S3LLM are broadly applicable and capable of integrating with source code analysis engines beyond just XScan.

In the conversion process from natural language to FQL queries, S3LLM must master three crucial elements: the purpose and syntax of FQL, comprehension of specific terminologies (e.g. high-performance computing (HPC) programming standards) presented in natural language inputs, and the establishment of an accurate translation from natural language to FQL. To equip the LLM models within S3LLM with a comprehensive grasp of FQL and its programming syntax, we have incorporated a foundational document on FQL alongside a collection of FQL query examples into the RAG framework as external data sources. For a detailed exploration of the RAG methodology utilized in this study, please refer to Section [3.4.](#page-5-0) Addressing the conversion of relevant terminologies from natural language inputs into programming code keywords posed a significant challenge. Initial attempts to generate these keywords using open-source LLM models yielded suboptimal results. Consequently, we select GPT-4 to serve as the terminology translator within S3LLM . This approach simplifies the creation of mappings from terminologies to corresponding programming keywords with precision. These mappings are also stored as external data within RAG. Finally, we prompt S3LLM to generate new FQL queries from provided natural language questions by utilizing few-shot learning techniques and enriching the context with RAG data.

## 3.3 Software Metadata Comprehension

In the quest to deepen our comprehension of large-scale scientific software, a variety of code metadata is extracted utilizing current software analysis tools. Particularly, metadata related to software architecture and data structures stands out as some of the most valuable and enlightening for understanding software intricacies. To capitalize on this rich metadata, S3LLM has been meticulously crafted not only to interpret these data but also to respond to queries informed by them. Fundamentally, our framework is adept at managing well-structured metadata formats, such as DOT, thereby enhancing its utility in parsing and understanding the underlying structure and organization of software code.

To enhance S3LLM 's capability to handle diverse information from scientific computing software, we implement a dual-phase strategy. Initially, we ensure that the LLMs grasp the structure and organization of metadata formats. This is achieved by integrating context rich in such information, utilizing either the RAG technique or by directly embedding metadata format information into the prompts. Subsequently, S3LLM allows users to interrogate the metadata through natural language prompts in such a context. Notably, S3LLM introduces two distinct prompting methodologies: zero-shot and few-shot modes. The zero-shot mode enables users to perform queries on metadata without requiring prior example inputs, whereas the few-shot mode solicits demonstration examples from users to refine and guide the LLM's responses. The few-shot will be more useful when processing very complex software metadata.

S3LLM currently supports three types of metadata extracted from large-scale scientific software: DOT, SQL, and specified data formats by third-party software. However, it is designed with the flexibility to easily accommodate additional metadata formats in the future. For the DOT format, we facilitate its understanding in S3LLM by incorporating a detailed explanation of DOT within the prompt, followed by appending the specific query question. Given the widespread use of SQL in relational database management, we leverage the LLaMA-2 models to generate SQL queries directly, without the need for instruction-based prompting techniques. For custom data formats specified by third-party software, we use the bespoke metadata produced by SPEL [\[22\]](#page-13-12), a toolkit developed for adapting E3SM models for GPU execution via OpenACC, as a case study. This choice illustrates S3LLM 's capability to interpret highly specialized data formats through the application of GPT-4, underscoring our commitment to extending S3LLM 's utility to encompass a broad spectrum of metadata types, including those tailored by third-party software analysis tools.

## <span id="page-5-0"></span>3.4 Technical Document Interpretation

Large-scale scientific software often comes with a comprehensive set of supplementary documentation, such as technical reports, user manuals, and research papers. While these documents are rich in detail, they can be difficult to navigate efficiently. To simplify the process of extracting relevant information from these extensive texts, S3LLM combines RAG with LLMs, significantly enhancing the accuracy of document-related queries. The RAG framework consists of three key components: document indexing, retrieval, and generation. Initially, it processes external texts by breaking them down into manageable segments for the LLM's contextual analysis. It then creates and stores document embeddings for future retrieval. When a query is received, the system retrieves relevant embeddings to form a context window for the LLM, which then generates responses based on a prompt that includes both the query and the retrieved data.

S3LLM adopts LangChain, an advanced open-source framework specifically designed for creating applications with LLMs, to implement RAG. LangChain's DocumentLoaders and Text Splitters are utilized to effectively organize and segment documents for query processing. Subsequently, VectorStore and Embeddings models are employed to generate and maintain document embeddings. For this task, we use all-MiniLM-L6-v2 document embeddings to create the embeddings and a FAISS-based similarity index vector storage for efficient retrieval. The Retriever component is crucial in obtaining the relevant segments to be included in the user-defined prompt. Lastly, the refined query, augmented with the retrieved data, is fed into LLaMA-2, which generates customized responses. This demonstrates the smooth integration of RAG within S3LLM , enhancing document comprehension in the field of scientific software.

# 4 Case Study

We deploy S3LLM on the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) as a case study to demonstrate its effectiveness in analyzing source code, code metadata, and text-based technical reports.

## 4.1 E3SM Introduction

The E3SM is a state-of-the-art Earth system modeling framework, developed and supported by the United States Department of Energy (DOE)[\[16\]](#page-12-8). This model is designed to facilitate the detailed simulation of intricate interactions among the Earth's atmospheric, terrestrial, oceanic, and cryospheric components. Standing as one of the most advanced Earth system models globally, E3SM is extensively utilized by the scientific community to explore a large range of critical subjects, including climate dynamics, meteorological prediction, and the assessment of natural hazards. E3SM has a very long history and is written mainly by legacy programming languages such as Fortran. In addition, E3SM contains more than one million lines of code. Therefore, we think E3SM is a qualified large-scale scientific computing software for evaluating the proposed S3LLM . Due to our special interest in kilometer-scale land component development on Exascale computers, we designed several demonstration queries focusing on the ultrahigh resolution E3SM Land Model (uELM) [\[27\]](#page-13-13).

## 4.2 Source Code Query Results

To illustrate the effectiveness of S3LLM in source code analysis, we assessed its ability to generate FQL (Feature Query Language) queries across three distinct categories: Library Utilization Queries, Version Assessment Queries, and Feature Enumeration Queries. Through the use of crafted prompts, as demonstrated in the subsequent text boxes, S3LLM successfully generates the correct FQL query in certain instances. Specifically, for the Library Utilization Query, S3LLM produces the precise FQL query in a zero-shot manner. This accuracy is likely attributed to the pretraining of the LLaMA-2 model within S3LLM on RAG supporting documents that include FQL queries and HPC terminologies. Similarly, for Version Assessment and Feature Enumeration Query, "Please Generate FQL query to Find the minimum version of MPI " and "Please Generate FQL query to List MPI process topology used in the Code" can prompt S3LLM to generate accurate queries.

Prompt for Library Utilization Query: Please Generate FQL query to Check Whether OpenMP is used Response: CHECK (omp task || end task || omp taskloop || omp taskloop simd || omp taskyield) WHERE (\*)

Prompt for Version Assessment Query: Please Generate FQL query to Find the minimum version of MPI Response: MAX (CHECK (MPI\_AINT\_DIFF) WHERE (\*) AS (31), CHECK (MPI\_COMM\_DUP\_WITH\_INFO) WHERE (\*) AS (30), CHECK (MPI\_COMM\_SET\_INFO) WHERE (\*) AS (30))

Prompt for Feature Enumeration Query: Please Generate FQL query to List MPI process topology used in the Code Response: LIST (CHECK (MPI\_CART\_CREATE WHERE(\*) AS (Cartesian), CHECK (MPI\_GRAPH\_CREATE WHERE(\*) AS (Graph), CHECK (MPI\_DIST\_GRAPH\_CREATE\_Adjacent WHERE(\*) AS (Distributed Graph)), CHECK (omp parallel num\_threads(dynamic) WHERE(\*) AS (Dynamic Threads), CHECK (omp schedule(static, dynamic, guided, auto, runtime)) WHERE(\*) AS (Scheduling))

## 4.3 Metadata Comprehension with S3LLM

In our study, we utilize three distinct forms of metadata to demonstrate the capabilities of S3LLM in enhancing metadata comprehension. These include DOT files produced by XScan [\[32\]](#page-13-11), CSV files generated by SPEL [\[22\]](#page-13-12)[6](#page-7-0) , and bespoke metadata formats also created by SPEL, all derived from the E3SM. This diverse dataset showcases S3LLM 's versatility and effectiveness in interpreting and leveraging different metadata representations to deepen our understanding of complex scientific software systems.

Our analysis begins with assessing S3LLM 's efficacy on standardized DOT files, as produced by XScan, and on a unique metadata format devised by SPEL. A DOT file, as illustrated in blow colored box, represents a directed graph that visualizes the interactions between caller and callee functions within E3SM, offering insights into the software's structural dynamics.

Structured query language (SQL) is widely used for processing information in relational databases, and LLaMA-2 models can conveniently translate natural language into SQL queries. To illustrate the SQL processing capabilities of S3LLM , we employ two example CSV files generated by SPEL [\[22\]](#page-13-12), as detailed in Table [2.](#page-8-0) Our approach involves a two-step process with S3LLM . First, we instruct S3LLM to generate SQL statements that transform the two subtables depicted in Table [2](#page-8-0) into formal SQL tables. Following this, we guide S3LLM to generate specific SQL queries: first, to identify the name of the component characterized by a 2D Dimension and having a Derived Type of col pp; and second, to construct a new SQL view by joining these two subtables. This methodology underscores S3LLM 's adeptness at navigating and manipulating SQL tables, showcasing its proficiency in facilitating advanced database operations.

Additionally, a sequence of execution for LakeTemperature as delineated by SPEL [\[22\]](#page-13-12) is shown in the colored box below. This example highlights the execution sequence within E3SM, where the first column lists variables utilized by the LakeTemperature module. The top row segments the execution flow into distinct phases {main (LakeTemperature) -> subroutine -> main -> subroutine -> main}, separated by "|", depicting the procedural pathway. Each column within these sections signifies a Fortran "do loop" sequence. The entries within this table specify each variable's role in the corresponding "do loop", with potential values being "ro" (read-only), "wo" (write-only), "rw" (read-write), or "-" (not in use). This offers an in-depth view of variable usage during the execution process, which is beneficial for code performance optimization (through asynchronous kernel launch) on GPUs. This structured approach to metadata analysis underscores S3LLM 's capability to navigate and elucidate complex metadata representations, enhancing comprehension and facilitating deeper insights into the software's operational mechanisms.

method's ability to understand and extract specific computational techniques, specifically the harmonic mean approach. Experiment 2 further demonstrates S3LLM 's efficacy by accurately describing the application of the Crank-Nicolson method within the model, showcasing its competence in elucidating detailed methodological implementations. Lastly, Experiment 3 confirms S3LLM 's proficiency in extracting complex physical processes, such as phase changes, and its capability in both comprehension and explanation. Collectively, these experiments underscore the robustness of our approach in navigating and interpreting sophisticated scientific documents, affirming its potential to significantly enhance the comprehension of complex scientific documentation interpretation.

### Prompt for Querying Technical Description of Lake Temperature -1:

What method is used to calculate the thermal conductivities at the interfaces between layers in the model?

Response: The thermal conductivities at layer interfaces are calculated as the harmonic mean of the conductivities of the neighboring layers.

### Prompt for Querying Technical Description of Lake Temperature -2:

How is the Crank-Nicolson method applied in the context of this model?

Response: The Crank-Nicolson method is used to solve equation (9.44) and it results in a tridiagonal system of equations.

## Prompt for Querying Technical Report of Lake Temperature -3:

What is the significance of phase changes in the model, and how are they accounted for?

Response: Phase changes, such as freezing and melting, play a significant role in the atmosphere model, as they affect the energy balance at the land surface. The model accounts for phase changes by calculating heat diffusion and phase change in given layers based on temperature and moisture conditions. The available energy for melting is computed as function of temperature and moisture content.

# 5 Discussion and Future Work

The foundational components of S3LLM, LLMs, have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in interpreting various data sources, including source code, metadata, and documents, offering insights from multiple angles. Despite these achievements, there are inherent limitations within LLMs that warrant further investigation in our future work. First, the constraint related to the maximum token count supported by open-source LLMs necessitates expansion to accommodate extensive queries, aiming to enhance in-context learning capabilities. Moreover, the treatment of specialized terminologies within domain-specific sciences requires refinement to ensure more accurate and dependable processing. Currently, commercial versions like GPT-4 are employed in S3LLM to derive coding keywords from terminologies; however, we posit that leveraging a more transparent, reproducible model, amenable to fine-tuning for domain-specific sciences, could optimize this process. Furthermore, S3LLM could be enriched with additional functionalities, such as identifying and addressing computational bottlenecks within large-scale codes and providing direct source code optimization recommendations. These areas of potential enhancement motivate us for the continued development and improvement of S3LLM in future iterations.

# 6 Conclusion

This paper presents S3LLM , a framework developed on the foundation of LLMs, aimed at unraveling the complexities inherent in large-scale scientific software. By enhancing the capabilities of LLaMA-2 models within S3LLM through innovative approaches such as instruction-based prompting, integration of external GPT-4 queries, and the adoption of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and LangChain techniques, we have significantly expanded the operational capacity of pre-trained LLMs. Our comprehensive evaluation across a variety of data types, including source code, diverse metadata formats (DOT, SQL, and specialized schemas), and textual documents, has validated the efficacy of S3LLM . It is our aspiration that S3LLM will illuminate pathways for forthcoming inquiries in the fields of generative AI and software engineering, particularly within the domain of scientific computing.
