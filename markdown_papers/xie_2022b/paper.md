## Abstract

Currently, large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in the field of psychological counseling. However, existing mental health LLMs overlook a critical issue where they do not consider the fact that different psychological counselors exhibit different personal styles, including linguistic style and therapy techniques, etc. As a result, these LLMs fail to satisfy the individual needs of clients who seek different counseling styles. To help bridge this gap, we propose PsyDT, a novel framework using LLMs to construct the Digital Twin of Psychological counselor with personalized counseling style. Compared to the timeconsuming and costly approach of collecting a large number of real-world counseling cases to create a specific counselor's digital twin, our framework offers a faster and more costeffective solution. To construct PsyDT, we utilize dynamic one-shot learning by using GPT-4 to capture counselor's unique counseling style, mainly focusing on linguistic style and therapy techniques. Subsequently, using existing singleturn long-text dialogues with client's questions, GPT-4 is guided to synthesize multi-turn dialogues of specific counselor. Finally, we finetune the LLMs on the synthetic dataset, Psy-DTCorpus, to achieve the digital twin of psychological counselor with personalized counseling style. Experimental results indicate that our proposed PsyDT framework can synthesize multi-turn dialogues that closely resemble realworld counseling cases and demonstrate better performance compared to other baselines, thereby show that our framework can effectively construct the digital twin of psychological counselor with a specific counseling style.[1](#page-0-0)

## 1 Introduction

In recent years, LLMs have made significant advancements, exemplified by ChatGPT [\(OpenAI,](#page-9-0)

In addition, with the global rise in the prevalence of depression and anxiety [\(Santomauro et al.,](#page-9-3) [2021\)](#page-9-3), mental health has garnered widespread attention, prompting researchers to explore the application of LLMs in psychological counseling. The value of mental health LLMs lies in their potentiality to provide emotional support and counseling services to individuals. Currently, a series of mental health LLMs have been proposed, including MeChat [\(Qiu et al.,](#page-9-4) [2024a\)](#page-9-4), PsyChat [\(Qiu et al.,](#page-9-5) [2024b\)](#page-9-5), SoulChat [\(Chen et al.,](#page-8-2) [2023\)](#page-8-2), EmoLLM [\(EmoLLM,](#page-8-3) [2024\)](#page-8-3), MindChat [\(Xin Yan,](#page-9-6) [2023\)](#page-9-6), CPsyCoun [\(Zhang et al.,](#page-9-7) [2024\)](#page-9-7), etc.

Due to ethics policy and privacy protection, realworld multi-turn mental health dialogues datasets are exceedingly rare. Consequently, most recent LLM-based mental health researches rely on syn-

thesizing multi-turn dialogues datasets. For instance, [Qiu et al.](#page-9-4) [\(2024a\)](#page-9-4) introduced SMILE, a technique for expanding single-turn dialogues into multi-turn dialogues, thereby better simulating realworld interactions between clients and counselors. Similarly, [Chen et al.](#page-8-2) [\(2023\)](#page-8-2) developed SoulChat-Corpus, a multi-turn empathetic dialogue dataset of more than 2 million samples, in which the input is the multi-turn dialogue context, and the target is empathetic responses that cover expressions such as questioning, comfort, recognition, listening, trust, emotional support, etc. [Zhang et al.](#page-9-7) [\(2024\)](#page-9-7) later proposed CPsyCoun, a report-based multiturn dialogue reconstruction and evaluation framework for Chinese psychological counseling.

However, despite the promising results of previous mental health LLMs, they overlook a critical issue where they do not take into account the fact that different psychological counselors exhibit different personal styles, including variations in linguistic style and therapy techniques. As a result, these LLMs struggle to meet the individual needs of clients who seek different counseling styles. Moreover, as illustrated in Figure [1,](#page-0-1) fine-tuning LLMs on multi-turn mental health dialogues datasets that blend multiple counseling styles often lead to instability in the response. To this end, we introduce the concept of psychological counselor's digital twin. To construct the digital twin, a large volume of real-world counseling cases from a specific psychological counselor are typically collected to fine-tune LLMs. However, the process of collecting counseling cases is not only time-consuming but also costly.

In response to these challenges, we propose PsyDT, a novel framework using LLMs to construct the Digital Twin of Psychological counselor with personalized counseling style. To construct PsyDT, we need to synthesize multi-turn dialogues of specific psychological counselor. To ensure the quality of the synthetic multi-turn dialogues, we first select 5,000 high-quality single-turn dialogues from the SoulChatCorpus [\(Chen et al.,](#page-8-2) [2023\)](#page-8-2). Subsequently, in order to promise the complexity and diversity of clients' linguistic style in the synthetic multi-turn dialogues, we employ GPT-4 to simulate the Big Five personality traits [\(Costa and McCrae,](#page-8-4) [1999\)](#page-8-4) of clients based on the clients' question from single-turn dialogues. To conduct real-world psychological counselor's digital twin, we invited a professional psychological counselor to play the role of digital twin. The counselor was asked to have conversations covering 12 counseling topics with 12 different clients. And then GPT-4 is employed to summarize the linguistic style and therapy technique according to counseling topic from above collected real-world counseling cases of the specific counselor. Combining the above simulated clients' personality, GPT-4 is used as the guidance for multi-turn dialogues synthesis of specific counselor. Finally, based on the synthetic multi-turn dialogues dataset, PsyDTCorpus, we construct the digital twin of psychological counselor with the specific counseling style using the multi-turn instruction fine-tuning (MIFT) method. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed PsyDT framework can quickly and cost-effectively construct the digital twin of psychological counselor with a specific counseling style, validating the effectiveness of the PsyDT framework.

In summary, the contributions of this work can be succinctly outlined as follows:

- To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to use LLMs to construct the digital twin of psychological counselor with personalized counseling style. The proposed multi-turn dialogues synthesis method of PsyDT framework can quickly and cost-effectively synthesize PsyDTCorpus, a high-quality multi-turn mental health dialogues dataset of psychological counselor with specific counseling style.
- We design automatic evaluations and manual evaluations of synthetic dataset and fine-tuned LLM of psychological counselor with specific counseling style to indicate effectiveness and superiority of our PsyDT framework.
- Experimental results indicate that PsyDT can synthesize multi-turn dialogues that closely resemble real-world counseling cases and demonstrate better performance compared to other baselines, thereby demonstrate the strong potential of PsyDT for application in real-world psychological counseling.

## 2 Methodology

This section explores the process of PsyDT framework. We first introduce multi-turn dialogues synthesis method of PsyDT, which consists of three components: Dynamic One-Shot Learning from Counseling Cases, Client Personality Simulation and Multi-Turn Mental Health Dialogues Synthesis, as shown in Figure [2.](#page-1-0) And then we fine-tune the LLMs on the synthetic dataset, PsyDTCorpus, to achieve the digital twin of psychological counselor with a specific counseling style. The specific process of synthesizing multi-turn dialogues is shown in Algorithm [1](#page-32-0) in the Appendix.

### 1 Single-Turn Dialogues Preparation

To ensure the quality of the synthetic multi-turn dialogues, we select 5,000 single-turn long-text dialogues with rich presentation of clients' personality traits from the SoulChatCorpus [\(Chen et al.,](#page-8-2) [2023\)](#page-8-2) by utilizing GPT-4 as the client personality

evaluator. An example of the single-turn long-text dialogues is shown in Figure [8](#page-12-0) in the appendix. These dialogues primarily consist of four components: *Counseling Topic*, *Title of Client's Question*, *Detail of Client's Question*, and *Counselor's Long Text Response*. The distribution of counseling topics is shown in Figure [3.](#page-2-0)

<span id="page-2-0"></span>![](_page_2_Figure_10.jpeg)
<!-- Image Description: This pie chart displays the percentage distribution of counseling topics. "Marriage" constitutes the largest segment (20.7%), followed by "Relationship" (13.4%) and "Emotion" (13.4%). Smaller segments represent topics such as "Family," "Treatment," "Behavior," "Career," "Growth," "Sex," "Social Events," and "Psychological Knowledge." The chart likely illustrates the prevalence of different issues addressed in counseling sessions within the study. -->

Figure 3: Distribution of counseling topics.

## 2 Dynamic One-Shot Learning from Counseling Cases

### 2.1 Real-World Counseling Cases Collection

To construct psychological counselor's digital twin, we invited a psychological counselor who meets national professional standards to provide psychological counseling. We recruited volunteers from online community, who were asked to select a counseling topic suitable for themselves. Before the consultation, volunteers were informed of precautions and were required to read and sign an informed consent form. During the formal consultation session, volunteers will engage in a dialogue with the psychological counselor. The entire session will follow the standard psychological consultation model and last for 50 minutes, conducted entirely via textbased communication. After the consultation, the counselor who conducted the session will review and verify the consultation records, correcting any errors and redacting any sensitive information to protect the privacy of the participants. In addition, we employ GPT-4 to conduct security checks and data cleaning on these counseling cases. As a result, the real-world counseling cases of the specific psychological counselor on 12 topics were collected,

with total number of 12 and total cost of \$2000 . One of the real-world counseling cases is presented in Figure [9](#page-14-0) in the Appendix (Counseling Topic: Relationship).

## 2.2 Linguistic Style and Therapy Technique Summarization

In real-world psychotherapy scenarios, different psychological counselors exhibit distinct personal styles, including unique linguistic style and therapy techniques, etc. To construct above psychological counselor's digital twin, we first employ GPT-4 to capture the linguistic style from several collected real-world counseling cases. The prompt and one example of the summarized linguistic style from counseling case of Figure [9](#page-14-0) are illustrated in Figure [10,](#page-15-0) [11](#page-15-1) in the appendix. Subsequently, we also employ GPT-4 to summarize the therapeutic type of collected counseling cases of specific counselor. The prompt is shown in Figure [12](#page-16-0) in the Appendix. According to statistics, 12 counseling cases all use rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT) [\(Dry](#page-8-5)[den,](#page-8-5) [2005\)](#page-8-5) for psychological counseling. And then the therapeutic type is used to retrieve the corresponding knowledge from the therapy technique knowledge base. Some therapeutic types and details of the knowledge base are presented in Table [3,](#page-16-1) [4](#page-17-0) in the appendix.

### 3 Client Personality Simulation

To ensure both complexity and diversity of clients' linguistic style in synthetic multi-turn dialogues, we employ GPT-4 to simulate the Big Five personality traits [\(Costa and McCrae,](#page-8-4) [1999\)](#page-8-4) of clients based on their question. The Big Five personality theory encompasses five core dimensions: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism (OCEAN). The prompt and an example of simulated client personality traits from single-turn dialogue of Figure [8](#page-12-0) are illustrated in Figure [13,](#page-18-0) [14](#page-19-0) in the Appendix.

## 4 Multi-Turn Mental Health Dialogues Synthesis

In order to prevent excessive homogenization of synthesized multi-turn dialogues, we enable singleturn dialogues to dynamically match real-world counseling cases based on counseling topics. The summarized linguistic style and therapy technique with specific topic and extracted client's Big Five personality traits polymerized with counseling case with specific topic, emotion guide and response

guide, GPT-4 is employed to synthesize single-turn dialogue into multi-turn dialogues. We denote synthetic multi-turn dialogues dataset as PsyDTCorpus. The prompt and an example of PsyDTCorpus from single-turn dialogue of Figure [8](#page-12-0) are illustrated in Figure [15,](#page-20-0) [16](#page-22-0) in the Appendix.

### 5 PsyDTLLM Model

Based on the synthetic multi-turn dialogues dataset, PsyDTCorpus, we construct the specific psychological counselor's digital twin LLM (PsyDTLLM) through multi-turn instruction fine-tuning (MIFT). The loss ℓ<sup>θ</sup> during training is,

$$
\ell_{\theta} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \ell(\hat{y}_i, y_i)
$$
 (1)

$$
y_i = LLM_{\theta}(c_{< i})\tag{2}
$$

where θ, yˆ<sup>i</sup> , y<sup>i</sup> , c<i denote the trainable parameters of the LLM, the i-th target utterance of counselor, the i-th predicted utterance of counselor, dialogue history with less than i turns, respectively.

## 3 Experiments

In this section, we conduct multiple comprehensive analyses of the synthesized multi-turn dialogues dataset PsyDTCorpus and the fine-tuned PsyDTLLM of psychological counselor with specific counseling style. In summary, we address the following research questions (RQs):

- RQ1: How similar is the synthetic multi-turn dialogue dataset with real-world counseling cases of specific counselor?
- RQ2: What is the performance of PsyDTCorpus as compared with baseline datasets?
- RQ3: Do the different components in the multi-turn dialogues synthesis method of PsyDT synthesize the corresponding effect of PsyDTCorpus?
- RQ4: What is the performance of Psy-DTLLM as compared with baseline LLMs?

### 1 Analysis of PsyDTCorpus Dataset

### 1.1 RQ1: Similarity Analysis

To validate the effectiveness of the multi-turn dialogues synthesis method of PsyDT framework, we compare the multi-turn mental health dialogues constructed by three methods, which are *PsyDT\_Prompt*, *SoulChat\_Prompt*[\(Chen et al.,](#page-8-2)

<span id="page-4-2"></span>![](_page_4_Figure_0.jpeg)
<!-- Image Description: The image displays two radar charts comparing three chatbot prompts (Smile, SoulChat, PsyDT) across various aspects of therapeutic conversation. Chart (a) shows the linguistic style, while chart (b) shows therapy technique. Each axis represents a category (e.g., emotion, family, career) with percentage scores indicating the prompt's focus on that area. The charts illustrate differences in the relative emphasis each prompt places on different therapeutic domains. -->

[2023\)](#page-8-2),*Smile\_Prompt*[\(Qiu et al.,](#page-9-4) [2024a\)](#page-9-4). For each topic, We randomly select 20 single-turn dialogue samples. Then, all the samples are used to synthesize multi-turn dialogues based on the above three methods, respectively. Given the potential of using LLMs for evaluating text generation quality [\(Chi](#page-8-6)[ang and Lee,](#page-8-6) [2023\)](#page-8-6), we attempt to automatically assess the similarity between three synthetic multiturn dialogues dataset and real-world counseling cases in the matter of linguistic style and therapy technique. We employ two state-of-the-art LLMs as evaluators: GPT-4o[2](#page-4-0) and Claude 3.5[3](#page-4-1) . We take the average of the similarity scores given by two LLMs as the final result. The detailed content of the prompt is shown in Figure [17,](#page-23-0) [18](#page-23-1) in the Appendix.

Figure [4](#page-4-2) illustrates that the similarity between multi-turn dialogues synthesized with*PsyDT\_Prompt*and real-world counseling cases is approximately 70%, surpassing multi-turn dialogues synthesized with*Smile\_Prompt*and*SoulChat\_Prompt*, especially in therapy technique. It indicates that the multi-turn dialogue synthesis method of PsyDT has excellent alignment performance in the linguistic style and therapy technique of the specific psychological counselor, which can effectively synthesize multi-turn dialogues of counselor with specific counseling style.

### 1.2 RQ2: Overall Dataset Comparisons

To validate the superiority of the synthetic multiturn dialogues dataset PsyDTCorpus, we conduct a comprehensive comparison between PsyDTCor-

pus and the following datasets: SMILECHAT [\(Qiu](#page-9-4) [et al.,](#page-9-4) [2024a\)](#page-9-4), SoulChatCorpus [\(Chen et al.,](#page-8-2) [2023\)](#page-8-2), and CPsyCounD [\(Zhang et al.,](#page-9-7) [2024\)](#page-9-7). Detailed information regarding the employed datasets is provided in Table [1.](#page-5-0) *Open.*, *Size*, *NoT.*, *LoC.*, *LoP.*, *EmoE.*, *CogE.*, *TheT.* respectively represent opensource, dataset size, average number of turns, average length of client's response, average length of psychological counselor's response, emotional empathy[4](#page-4-3) , cognitive empathy [\(Preston and De Waal,](#page-9-8) [2002\)](#page-9-8), therapy technique. We randomly select 50 dialogue samples from each of these four datasets for a manual evaluation. Our evaluation team consists of four senior psychological postgraduate students and an experienced psychotherapist to ensure accuracy and professionalism. The evaluation metrics are listed in Table [5](#page-24-0) in the Appendix. Based on references [Swank and Lambie,](#page-9-9) [2012](#page-9-9) and [Associa](#page-8-7)[tion et al.,](#page-8-7) [2012,](#page-8-7) we summarize four professional assessment dimensions in the field of psychological counseling: Conversation Strategy (*Con.*), State and Attitude (*Sta.*), Relationship Building (*Rel.*), and Application of Therapy Technique (*App.*). Additionally, we manually evaluate the fluency (*Flu.*) and safety (*Saf.*) of the data. The rating scale of *Con.*, *Sta.*, *Rel.*and*App.*is (0, 1, ..., 9, 10), while (0,1) for Flu., where higher score means better. Fleiss' κ [\(Fleiss,](#page-8-8) [1971\)](#page-8-8) for*Con.*, *Sta.*, *Rel.*, *The.*and*Inf.* are 0.411, 0.403, 0.407, 0.435 and 0.547, indicating moderate annotation agreement respectively.

significantly outperforms the other datasets across all four professional assessment dimensions. To visually illustrate the stability and score distribution of our multi-turn dialogues dataset compared to other datasets across these four dimensions, we design boxplots of the evaluation results. As shown in Figure [5,](#page-5-1) it is evident that PsyDTCorpus excels in quality across all four dimensions compared to the other baseline datasets. These results underscore the better superiority and professionalism of PsyDTCorpus over the other baseline datasets, indicating the strong potential of PsyDT for application in real-world psychological counseling.

## 1.3 RQ3: Ablation Studies

To validate that our synthetic multi-turn dialogues dataset, PsyDTCorpus, integrates linguistic style, therapy technique, and client personality, we design three ablation manual evaluations. Our evaluation team consists of four senior psychological postgraduate students and an experienced psychotherapist to ensure accuracy and professionalism. We randomly select 16 single-turn dialogues. Using multi-turn dialogues synthesis method of PsyDT from Figure [15,](#page-20-0) we synthesize these 16 sets of dialogues, each time excluding one of the following elements: linguistic style, therapy technique, and client personality. The evaluators are asked to choose the dialogues that best represented the corresponding linguistic style, therapy technique, and client personality between original dialogue and ablated dialogues. We took the optimal answer for each set of dialogue from the five evaluators through voting mechanism and then calculating the agreement for all 16 sets. As shown in Figure [6,](#page-5-2) our synthetic multi-turn dialogue achieved a fidelity of over 60%. This demonstrates that our multi-turn dialogues synthesis method of PsyDT framework can effectively integrate linguistic style, therapy technique, and client personality.

### 2 Analysis of PsyDTLLM model

### 2.1 Baselines

We compare PsyDTLLM with the following baselines.

• Closed-source: ChatGPT [\(OpenAI,](#page-9-0) [2022;](#page-9-0) [Ouyang et al.,](#page-9-10) [2022\)](#page-9-10); GPT-4 [\(OpenAI,](#page-9-1) [2024\)](#page-9-1).

- Open-source: Baichuan2-7B-Chat [\(Yang](#page-9-11) [et al.,](#page-9-11) [2023\)](#page-9-11); GLM4-9B-Chat [\(GLM et al.,](#page-9-12) [2024\)](#page-9-12); InternLM2-Chat-7B [\(Cai et al.,](#page-8-9) [2024\)](#page-8-9); Llama3-8B-Instruct [\(Touvron et al.,](#page-9-2) [2023\)](#page-9-2); Llama3.1-8B-Instruct [\(Touvron et al.,](#page-9-2) [2023\)](#page-9-2); Qwen2-7B-Instruct [\(Yang et al.,](#page-9-13) [2024\)](#page-9-13); Yi-1.5-9B-Chat [\(Young et al.,](#page-9-14) [2024\)](#page-9-14).

To facilitate a more accurate comparison of the capabilities of various models, we choose models of similar magnitudes, such as the 6B/7B/8B/9B model parameter sizes for comparison.

## 2.2 Implementation details

The Qwen2-7B-Instruct is used as the backbone. The whole implementation is based on the LLaMA-Factory [\(Zheng et al.,](#page-9-15) [2024\)](#page-9-15). PsyDTLLM is finetuned for 3 epochs on the proposed PsyDTCorpus with a batch size of 2 per GPU, using 8 NVIDIA-A800-80G GPUs. The cosine-type learning rate scheduler with warmup\_ratio = 0.03 and warmup\_max\_lr = 1.0e − 5 is used. 16-bit half-precision floating point numbers is utilized to accelerate training and improves model performance. The random seed is set to 42. In the inference phase, all the LLMs adopt the following configuration: temperature=0.9, top\_p=0.75, top\_k=20.

## 2.3 RQ4: Overall Model Comparisons

To verify the superiority of PsyDTLLM compared to other baseline models, we randomly split the PsyDTCorpus dataset into 4760 sets of training data and 240 sets of testing data. The testing data includes 12 topics, each with 20 sets of data, for a total of 4311 turns to conduct automatic evaluation. For each sample, each model generates an answer for evaluation. We used 5 evaluation metrics as automatic metrics: ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L [\(Lin,](#page-9-16) [2004\)](#page-9-16), BLEU-4 [\(Papineni et al.,](#page-9-17) [2002\)](#page-9-17), FBERT of BERTSCORE [\(Zhang\\* et al.,](#page-9-18) [2020\)](#page-9-18). Generally, as shown in Table [2,](#page-7-0) PsyDTLLM outperforms other baseline models in both automatic evaluation metrics, which demonstrates that PsyDTLLM outperforms other baseline models in the semantic understanding ability.

Subsequently, we randomly extracts 20 turns of data from each topic for a total of 240 turns to conduct professional evaluation. We also employ two state-of-the-art LLMs as evaluators: GPT-4o and Claude 3.5. We take the average of the scores given by two LLMs as the final result. The metrics to assess are as follows: Emotional Empathy (*EmoE.*), Cognitive Empathy (*CogE.*), Conversation Strategy (*Con.*), State and Attitude (*Sta.*), and Safety (*Saf.*). The ranting scale of *EmoE.*, *CogE.*, *Con.*, *Sta.*is (0, 1, 2, 3) and*Saf.*is (0, 1), where higher score means better. The detailed content of the prompt is shown in Figure [19,](#page-25-0) [20,](#page-26-0) [21,](#page-27-0) [22,](#page-28-0) and [23](#page-29-0) in the Appendix. Generally, as shown in Table [2,](#page-7-0) PsyDTLLM outperforms other baseline models in both professional metrics, demonstrating better performance in the psychological counseling, thereby indicating the strong potential of PsyDT for application in realworld psychological counseling.

## 3 Case Study

In this section, we present an close look for examples of clients seeking emotional support from ChatGPT, Qwen2-7B-Instruct, SoulChat, CPsy-CounX, and PsyDTLLM via case studies. as shown in Figure [24,](#page-30-0) [25,](#page-30-1) [26,](#page-31-0) [27,](#page-33-0) and [28](#page-35-0) in the Appendix, respectively. ChatGPT and Qwen2-7B-Instruct tend to provide advice rather than asking questions or listening. SoulChat fails to satisfy the individual need of client who seek specific counseling styles. CPsy-CounX tries to explicitly use some professional therapy terms in its replies, which may cause confusion for clients who are not in the field of psychology. Our PsyDTLLM, like a real-world psychological counselor, implicitly expresses emotional empathy and cognitive empathy to meet the needs of clients who seek specific counseling styles.

## 1 Mental Health LLMs

LLMs typically underperform in domains requiring complex mental acumen and high levels of empathy. Nonetheless, significant advancements have been made by researchers. For instance, [Qiu et al.](#page-9-4) [\(2024a\)](#page-9-4) introduced SMILE approach, leveraging ChatGPT to transform single-turn dialogues into multi-turn interactions. [Chen et al.](#page-8-2) [\(2023\)](#page-8-2) developed SoulChat and SoulChatCorpus, a multi-turn empathetic conversation dataset comprising over 2 million samples. By fine-tuning LLM on SoulChat-Corpus, they achieved superior performance in em-

pathetic dialogue tasks. [Zhang et al.](#page-9-7) [\(2024\)](#page-9-7) presented CPsyCoun, a framework for reconstructing and evaluating multi-turn dialogues in Chinese psychological counseling. To optimize the utilization of counseling reports, they proposed a two-phase method for generating high-quality dialogues. Furthermore, they established a comprehensive evaluation benchmark for automatic assessment of multiturn psychological counseling. In this paper, we propose PsyDT, a novel framework using LLMs to construct the digital twin of psychological counselor with personalized counseling style.

### 2 Therapy Techniques

Psychological therapy techniques significantly contribute to individual mental well-being and overall quality of life. These methods support individuals in identifying, addressing, and managing psychological challenges and conflicts [\(Meier,](#page-9-19) [2010\)](#page-9-19). Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) [\(Dryden,](#page-8-5) [2005\)](#page-8-5), developed by psychologist Albert Ellis in the 1950s, is a prominent form of psychotherapy that highlights the role of irrational beliefs in causing emotional distress and dysfunctional behavior. REBT posits that psychological disturbances are not caused by events themselves but by individuals' interpretations and reactions to these events. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) [\(Beck,](#page-8-10) [1979\)](#page-8-10),

primarily developed by Aaron Beck in the 1960s, is a widely practiced and highly effective form of psychotherapy that focuses on the interplay between thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. CBT is recognized as one of the most prominent and well-researched approaches in the field of psychology. Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) [\(Line](#page-9-20)[han,](#page-9-20) [2014\)](#page-9-20), created by psychologist Marsha M. Linehan in the late 1980s, is a comprehensive psychotherapeutic approach initially designed for individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD). It has since been adapted to treat various other mental health conditions, including depression, anxiety disorders, substance abuse, and eating disorders.

## 5 Conclusion

In this paper, we propose PsyDT, a novel framework using LLMs to construct the digital twin of psychological counselor with personalized counseling style. The proposed multi-turn dialogues synthesis method of PsyDT framework can quickly and cost-effectively synthesize PsyDTCorpus, a high-quality multi-turn mental health dialogues dataset of psychological counselor with specific counseling style, which closely resemble realworld counseling cases. This indicates the strong potential of PsyDT for application in real-world psychological counseling.

## Limitation and Future Work

Although the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PsyDT, there are still some limitations need to consider. Psychological counseling is complex. Our framework only constructs digital twin of psychological counselor with specific counseling style, which satisfies the individual needs of clients who seek specific counseling style, but can not guarantee to solve their psychological problems and meet counseling needs of all clients. In addition, relying solely on one psychological counselor is somewhat arbitrary, we hope to continue exploring the application of multiple psychological counselors in the joint diagnosis in the field of mental health LLMs in the future.

## Ethical Statement

- Data Private: We implemented a rigorous data cleaning protocol to synthesis our dataset and ensure privacy protection [\(Hovy and](#page-9-21) [Spruit,](#page-9-21) [2016\)](#page-9-21). These measures included rulebased cleaning, manual rewriting, and human proofreading to guarantee the absence of sensitive or private content. For instance, the initial data collection contained private information from psychologists, such as personal details, contact information, addresses, and workplaces. Following the cleaning process, all such sensitive information was entirely removed, ensuring the protection of personal data. Additionally, any conversations with potential harm to clients, others, or society were thoroughly expunged from our dataset.
- Potential Risks of the Model: During the human evaluation phase, we conducted a focused safety assessment of the model's outputs. Given the absence of human feedback during the model fine-tuning phase, some responses may inevitably pose potential harm to users. If there is no noticeable improvement in user interactions with the PsyDTLLM model, we strongly recommend seeking immediate assistance from a professional counselor or psychiatrist. It is crucial to remember that virtual conversational agents cannot replace real-world therapy. Furthermore, when implementing this model in downstream applications, responses generated by the AI should be used solely as references.
- Annotator Compensation: We engaged ex-

perts in psychology to conduct a manual evaluation of the model's output. Each annotator spent approximately 3 minutes assessing each sample, for which they received a compensation of \$0.418. This corresponds to an hourly wage of \$8.36, which is higher than the current U.S. federal minimum wage of \$7.25 per hour.

## Single-Turn Dialogue in English

### "Counseling Topic": Relationship

**"Title of Client's Question":**Interpersonal Sensitivity and Emotional Distress**"Detail of Client's Question":**I previously had a bestfriend, A, whom I had known since middle school, and she was the only friend Ihad. In high school, another girl, B, joined our group. B and A shared common interests, and they often walked together, leaving me mostly silent during these moments. B's remarks, though perhaps intended as jokes,were often hurtful. Eventually, my friend C, from another class, confronted B on my behalf, which led to my falling out with her. Over time, I realized that if I didn't reach out to A, she wouldn't initiate contact, and it felt like I was the one keeping our friendship alive. This was draining. Before we parted ways, A had invited both B and me to her birthday, but after the fallout, A invited B and her friends without even calling me. I felt deeply hurt. In class, I only interacted with A, and as a result, I ended up isolated, with no other friends. Later, after switching desks, I became less lonely, but I still felt very sensitive. Hearing A and B laugh together would instantly depress me, and I found myself unable to control my emotions. I feel helpless and distressed. Although I understand the importance of focusing on my studies, I cannot stop how I feelwhenever I hear them; it's overwhelming and painful.
**"Counselor's Long-Text Response":** Hello, I can deeply empathize with the feelings you're experiencing. The dynamics in your friendship with A, especially the interference caused by B, have left you feeling helpless and distressed. It is completely natural to feel a sense of abandonment and loss when a close friendship begins to deteriorate.Your confusion and hurt regarding A's actions are understandable. These emotions may challenge yoursense of self-worth and confidence, which can, in turn, affect both your academic and personal life. It seems that this experience has also led to feelings of doubt and mistrust towards A. I would suggest considering the possibility of having a direct conversation with her, where you can openly share your feelings and concerns. It is possible that A did not intend to hurt you and may have found herself uncertain about how to navigate the complex dynamics in your friendship. A candid dialogue might help clear up misunderstandings or offer a better way to resolve these issues. At the same time, I recognize how emotionally exhausting and disheartening this situation has been for you. In times like these, it is crucial to show kindness and care towards yourself. I encourage you to engage in activities that you enjoy and that can help alleviate your stress, such as exercising, reading, or engaging in a creative hobby like painting. These activities may help you regain emotional balance, allowing you to approach your situation with a clearer and more resilient mindset. Lastly, please remember that this difficult chapter will not define yourlife. Everyone encounters challenges in relationships, and these experiences are part of personal growth. Trust in your ability to overcome this, and believe that you will find friends who truly appreciate and value you. If you feel that these emotional struggles are affecting your day-to-day life significantly, seeking guidance from a professional therapist could provide you with more structured support and strategies to cope.

## Dialogue in Chinese Dialogue in English

来访者:我现在在班级里担任班长一职,在处理班 级事务的过程中感觉到同学之间很冷淡,对于我组 织的一些活动,同学们的参与度普遍不高,让我很 苦恼。

咨询师:您的预期是大家都来参与,但实际结果是 同学们参与度不高,是这样吗?您说的同学之间很 冷淡,是指的同学们不爱彼此交往,还是只对组织 的活动冷淡?

来访者:我的预期倒也不是希望班里的同学都来, 因为上了研究生了大家有自己的科研压力,无暇参 加班级活动倒也正常,只是我后面听说很多人其实 那天并没有科研任务,只是单纯不想参与班级活动 而已。

咨询师:我们组织了活动,肯定是希望大家都来参 与。辛辛苦苦付出了,没有被看到,心里会有些不 舒服。

来访者:就是他们觉得班级里同学之间的交流是没 什么必要的,他们只在实验室自己的小团体活跃, 跟大班级的交流感觉像无效社交。 咨询师:因为大家没来参与,这件事,对您的影响 大吗?

来访者:是的呀,那时候辛辛苦苦组织了一场活动, 还拉了个群,我们班总共有60个人,进群有40个人, 最后只来了15个人,让我感到很失望。 咨询师:之前有过类似经历吗?比如大学期间,组 织活动,来参加的人远远小于预期。您提到"很失

望",看得出来,您是一位责任心很强的人,因为 有强烈的责任心,所以对活动的参与人数也有期待。

的,记得当时班级破冰30个人才一两个人没来,当 时玩得还是挺开心的,上了研究生之后感觉大家都 很冷漠。我作为班长,还是希望能够提升班级的凝 聚力,不会做到以后大家都不认识我这个班长,大 家彼此相互不认识的现象,如果这样的话会让我感 到我很失职。

咨询师:明白了,同学们没来参与活动,会让您感 觉到,是您哪些地方没有做到位,自己失职了。有 没有这种可能性:您已经把活动准备的很精细到位, 只是大家因为年龄、兴趣、科研任务等原因,很少 人来参与活动?

来访者:可能是吧,因为那次活动是一次桌游活动, 首先会有一个自我介绍环节,就是想让大家相互熟 悉,然后有后面的娱乐活动。

咨询师:本来您是想通过这场活动,组织大家相互 认识。看得出来,您确实动了一番脑筋,精心策划 了的,这种情况下,来的人不到预期的一半,确实 很失望。

来访者:后面我猜测大家是不是喜欢球类运动多一 些,也拉了一个羽毛球群,但是进群的人很多,很 多次我在上面喊大家来打羽毛球,但是只有三四个 人来打,群里只有我一个人的独角戏。 咨询师:有您做大家的班长,感觉他们挺幸运的, 即便错过了上一场活动,大概率还会有下一场。

Client: I currently serve as the class president. However, I've noticed a general sense of indifference among my classmates when it comes to participating in class activities. Their lack of engagement has been particularly frustrating for me.

Counselor: It seems you expected greater participation, but the actual turnout has been disappointing. When you mention "indifference," do you mean that your classmates are generally unengaged with one another, or is it specifically related to the activities you organize?

Client: My expectation wasn't that everyone would participate, especially since we're now in graduate school, where research demands can be overwhelming. It's understandable if some people don't attend class activities. However, I later heard that many classmates didn't have any research commitments that day—they simply chose not to participate. Counselor: Organizing an event naturally comes with the hope that many will attend. It can be disheartening when your efforts aren't recognized or appreciated.

Client: It seems that many of them view interactions within the class as unnecessary. They are more active within their smaller lab groups and see engagement with the larger class as a form of ineffective socializing. Counselor: Did the low attendance have a significant impact on you? Client: Yes, it did. I put a lot of effort into organizing the event, even creating a group chat for it. Out of the 60 classmates,40 joined the chat, but only 15 attended the event. I was very disappointed. Counselor: Have you experienced similar situations before? For example, during your undergraduate years, did you organize events where attendance fell short of expectations? You mentioned feeling "disappointed," which suggests you have a strong sense of responsibility. This likely contributes to your high expectations for event participation.

来访者:本科的时候还好,班级的同学还是很团结 Client: During my undergraduate years, things were different. My classmates were more united. I recall organizing an ice-breaking event where only one or two out of 30 people didn't show up. It was a lot of fun back then. But in graduate school, the atmosphere feels much colder. As class president, I want to strengthen our class cohesion. It would be disheartening if, by the end of our studies, everyone barely knows who I am, or worse, if they don't know each other atall. That would make me feellike I've failed in my role.

> Counselor: I understand. When your classmates don'tparticipate, it makes you question whether you've done enough in your role. Is it possible that you've organized the event meticulously, but due to factors like age, differing interests, and research obligations, many didn't feel compelled to join?

Client: That could be the case.The event I organized was a board game session, beginning with introductions to help everyone get to know each other, followed by the games themselves.

Counselor: It's clear that you put a lot of thought into organizing the event with the aim of fostering connections among your classmates. Given that less than half of the expected attendees showed up, it's understandable that you'd feel disappointed.

Client: Later on, I thought they might prefer sports, so I created a badminton group chat. Although many joined the group, when I invited them to play, only three or four people ever showed up. It felt like I was just talking to myself.

Counselor: Your classmates are fortunate to have you as theirclass president. Even if they missed last event, there's a good chance you'll organize another. <span id="page-14-0"></span>来访者:就是感觉大家不是很积极,每次都要我在 群里冒泡,而且也没有收到大家的任何反馈,没有 人理我。

咨询师:您回想在大学期间,大一和大四做比较的 话,组织班级活动,参与的人数,会有所差异吗?

来访者:嗯嗯,慢慢地我后面也不想组织这样的活 动了,感觉特别累,人累心更累。大一的时候大家 还是小白,而且主要是以上课为主,对于班级活动 还是挺上心的,到了大四忙着找工作,就没什么班 级活动了。

咨询师:这么说来,年龄变量,对于活动的参与度 来说,还挺关键的。如果后面不再组织活动,您会 有上面提到的"失职"的感受吗?

来访者:多多少少还是会有的,但是如果没有人考 虑我的感受,我也就慢慢淡化了,因为我也有自己 的科研压力,也没办法所有心思放在班级活动上。 咨询师:我记得我读书的时候,研究生期间,除了 党小组活动,大家不敢缺席,其他活动,如果没有 严格要求,确实各干各的情况比较多。有时候如果 运气好,班里会有几个爱张罗事儿的同学,他们喜 欢联络,并乐此不疲,组织班级活动,有这样的同 学帮忙招呼,估计来的人数会有所增加。

来访者:是的,基本上就是我一个人带头组织,如 果没有我带头,其它班干部基本都是不干事的,所 以有时就是感觉挺无奈的。

咨询师:研究生期间,组织活动的难度不小,只靠 一个人,确实会很辛苦。有想过在筹划一场活动之 前,先把所有班干部召集起来,群策群力吗?

来访者:有的,其实班干部还好啦,只不过需要一 个管理者指挥他们要做啥,我也会询问他们的一些 建议。

咨询师:明白,您就是这位管理者。

来访者:是的,只不过对于现在同学之间的人际关 系感到挺迷茫的。

再到实施,各个环节,该考虑的环节都考虑了。同 学之间的人际关系,是亲密还是疏远,这个我们可 以控制吗?

来访者:好像也控制不了,只是作为班长我觉得班 里的同学至少应该要相互认识。是不是我管得有点 太多了,有点自寻烦恼。

好,您才会有让大家都来参与活动的期待。期待值 很高,付出也很多,而结果不如意,换做是任何人 都会失望的。有您做班长,是大家伙的福气。只是 并不一定所有人都能意识到。

来访者:哈哈谢谢你这样子夸我,要是大家能明白 我的良苦用心就好了。我也在努力调整好自己的心 态,把自己能做的事情做好,剩下的就听天由命了。 咨询师:尽人事听天命,把我们能控制的,努力做 好,不能控制的,也不过度责怪自己。

来访者:我感觉好多了,谢谢你! 咨询师:不客气,感谢您的信任!

Client: It just feels like no one is very enthusiastic. I always have to be the one to initiate conversations in the group, and I rarely receive any feedback. No one even acknowledges my messages.

Counselor: If you reflect on your undergraduate years, was there a noticeable difference in attendance between your first and final years when organizing class activities?

Client: Yes, definitely. Over time, I became less motivated to organize events. It's exhausting—both physically and mentally. In the first year, everyone was new, and most activities were centered around classes, so people were more invested. By the final year, everyone was focused on job hunting, and class activities nearly disappeared.

Counselor: It seems age and life stage play significant roles in participation. If you decide not to organize any more activities, would you still feel that sense of "failure" you mentioned earlier?

Client: To some extent, yes. But if no one considers my feelings, I'll gradually let it go. I have my own research pressures and can't dedicate all my energy to class activities.

Counselor: I remember during my own graduate studies, aside from mandatory activities like those organized by the party committee, attendance at other events was often low unless there was someone particularly enthusiastic about organizing. Having a few proactive individuals could really boost participation.

Client: Yes, most of the organizing falls to me.Without my initiative, the other class officers don't really step up, which can be frustrating. Counselor: It's certainly challenging to organize events during graduate school, especially on your own. Have you considered gathering all the class officers to brainstorm together before planning an event?

Client: I have, and the other officers are generally cooperative. They just need guidance on what to do,and I often ask for their input. Counselor: It sounds like you are that guiding force.

Client: Yes, but I still feel uncertain about the interpersonal dynamics

咨询师:如果抛开参与人数的因素,您从策划组织, among my classmates.Counselor: If we set aside attendance numbers for <sup>a</sup> moment, it seems you've thoroughly considered each stage of event planning and execution. The nature of interpersonal relationships—whether close or distant—is something we can't fully control, can we?

> Client: It seems not. As class president, I just feel that classmates should at least know each other. Am I perhaps being overly concerned and causing myself unnecessary stress?

咨询师:正是因为您有强烈的责任心,想把班长干 Counselor: Your strong sense of responsibility drives you to excel as class president, which naturally leads to high expectations for participation. When the outcome falls short, it's understandable to feel disappointed. Your classmates are fortunate to have you as theirleader, though they may not always realize it.

> Client: Thank you forsaying that. I justwish they could understand my good intentions. I'm trying to adjust my mindset, focus on what I can control, and leave the restto fate.

Counselor: Exactly. Do your best with what you can control, and try not to be too hard on yourself over what you can't.

Client: I feel much better, thank you! Counselor: You're welcome. Thank you foryour trust!

## OK!

从这段真实世界心理咨询场景的对话中,可以分 析出咨询师的语言风格特点包括:

1. 倾听和理解:咨询师通过开放式和探究性的 问题引导来访者描述自己的感受和体验,如"说 说您的困扰",以展示对来访者困扰的关注和理 解。

2. 重述和澄清:咨询师多次用自己的话重述来 访者所说的内容,如"是的呀,那时候辛辛苦苦 组织了一场活动",以确保准确理解来访者的情 绪和观点

3. 肯定和鼓励:咨询师在对话中肯定了来访者 的感受和付出,如"您是一位责任心很强的人", 通过正面的反馈和肯定来鼓励和支持来访者。

4. 引导自我反思:咨询师引导来访者对自身的 期望和行为进行反思,如"有没有这种可能性: 您已经把活动准备的很精细到位",帮助来访者 认识到可能的认知偏差或其他角度来看待问题。

访者的情绪变化,并适时给予情感支持,使对话 在一个安全舒适的环境中进行,如"不客气,感 谢您的信任!"

6. 提供新的视角:咨询师通过分享个人经验或 提出可能性来开拓来访者的思路,如"研究生期 间,除了党小组活动,大家不敢缺席,其他活 动..."。

7. 尊重和接纳:咨询师在对话中未对来访者的 任何想法或行为进行批评或评判,体现了对来访 者的尊重和无条件接纳,如"您回想在大学期 间..."。

8. 简洁明了:咨询师的语言通常简练、清晰, 避免使用专业术语,使交流更加易懂和亲切。 综上,咨询师的语言风格体现出了专业、同理心、 支持性和引导性。这些特点有助于建立与来访者 的良好关系,并为来访者提供一个温馨的沟通环 境和心理成长的空间。

From this real-world psychotherapy dialogue, we can identify several key characteristics ofthe counselor's linguistic style:

1. \*\*Listening and Understanding\*\*: The counselor uses open-ended and exploratory questions to guide the client in articulating their feelings and experiences. For example, "Could you tell me more about what's troubling you?" This approach demonstrates empathy and a genuine understanding of the client's concerns.

2. \*\*Paraphrasing and Clarifying\*\*: The counselor frequently restates the client's words in their own language, such as "Yes, you worked hard to organize the event," to ensure accurate comprehension of the client's emotions and viewpoints.

3. \*\*Affirming and Encouraging\*\*: Throughout the conversation, the counselor acknowledges and affirms the client's feelings and efforts. For example, "You are someone with a strong sense of responsibility." Such positive reinforcement helps to encourage and support the client.

4. \*\*Guiding Self-Reflection\*\*: The counselor encourages the client to reflect on their own expectations and behaviors. For instance, "Could it be that you have prepared the event so thoroughly?" This question helps the client recognize potential cognitive biases and consider alternative perspectives.

5. 把握情绪调节:咨询师在整个对话中注意来 5. \*\*Managing Emotional Regulation\*\*: The counselor is attentive to the client's emotional state throughout the conversation, offering timely emotionalsupport to maintain a safe and comfortable environment for dialogue. An example would be, "Thank you foryour trust; it's my pleasure to help."

> 6. \*\*Offering New Perspectives\*\*: The counselor introduces new viewpoints by sharing personal experiences orsuggesting possibilities, such as "During my graduate studies, we were expected to attend certain group activities, but we could also choose others…" This broadens the client's thinking.

7. \*\*Respecting and Accepting\*\*: At no point does the counselor criticize or judge the client's thoughts oractions, demonstrating unconditional acceptance and respect for the client. An example of this is, "When you think back to youruniversity years…"

8. \*\*Clear and Concise Language\*\*: The counselor's language is typically concise and clear, avoiding technical jargon to ensure the conversation is accessible and approachable.

In summary, the counselor's linguistic style reflects professionalism, empathy, supportiveness, and guidance. These traits foster a positive therapeutic relationship and provide the client with a nurturing environment conducive to communication and psychological growth.

|                                      | REBT involves several stages. Below are the dialogue stages and a brief description of<br>the focus of each stage:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|                                      | (1) Examine Irrational Beliefs and Self-Defeating Thoughts: In REBT, cognitive<br>intervention is viewed as the "lifeblood" of treatment. Thus, almost from the beginning<br>of therapy, during the problem exploration phase, the counselor actively and persuasively<br>helps the client explore the reasons behind their emotional distress. This includes under<br>standing the client's thought process regarding events, the antecedents, and consequences<br>of their emotions to clarify the problem. The counselor firmly encourages the client to<br>reflect on what they "tell" themselves when feeling anxious, depressed, or angry after<br>encountering a stimulus event.                   |
| Rational Emotive<br>Behavior Therapy | (2) Debate Irrational Beliefs: The counselor uses various techniques (primarily cog<br>nitive techniques) to help the client question and challenge their irrational beliefs and<br>thoughts, demonstrating their unrealistic and unreasonable aspects. The goal is for the<br>client to recognize the harm of these beliefs and develop a desire and behavior to abandon<br>them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|                                      | (3) Develop Rational Beliefs and Learn Rational Thinking: After identifying and<br>refuting irrational beliefs, the counselor further guides the client to find appropriate,<br>rational responses to triggering situations and events. The counselor helps the client<br>replace irrational beliefs and self-defeating thoughts with rational beliefs and objective,<br>problem-solving thinking statements. To reinforce rational beliefs, the counselor repeat<br>edly teaches the client why rational beliefs are reasonable, how they differ from irrational<br>beliefs, why irrational beliefs lead to emotional disturbances, and why rational beliefs<br>lead to more positive, healthy outcomes. |
|                                      | (4) Apply Therapeutic Gains in Real Life: The counselor encourages the client to<br>internalize the objective, realistic attitudes and scientifically rational thinking methods<br>learned in therapy and to persistently apply them to solve new problems in their future<br>life.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

(1)开放性:来访者可能在开放性上得分不高。 她似乎在遇到新朋友B的时候,没有表现出强烈 的新事物接受度或者对不同类型的友谊的好奇。 她更倾向于与熟悉的朋友A保持关系,而不是尝 试与B建立新的联系。同时,来访者对B的开玩笑 可能没能很好地适应或理解,这表明了她对新奇 或具有挑战性的社交互动的适应能力可能较低。

在描述中,她没有明显显示出组织性或自律性的 问题,也没有涉及任何与勤勉或规则遵守直接相 关的行为。她确实尽力维持与朋友A的友谊,这 显示了一定程度的承诺和努力。然而,由于没有 更多信息,对于她的责任心水平难以作出更具体 的判断。

(3)外向性:来访者似乎在外向性上得分较低。 她在社交场合中表现出来的行为和感受显示,她 可能更喜欢独处或仅与很亲近的朋友互动。她描 述了在A和B一起走的时候自己不说话的情况,这 可能暗示她在社交活动中更保守和被动。她也表 示失去了朋友A之后变得没有朋友,可能显示了 对于建立新的社交联系的不积极。

(4)宜人性:来访者在宜人性方面可能表现中 等或偏低。她对朋友B的行为感到受伤害,并没 有选择直接和B沟通,而是通过另一个朋友C来解 决冲突,这可能表示她在处理人际关系的冲突时 可能不够直接。她也体现出对A的友谊感到失望, 因为A在不经她同意的情况下改变了他们的关系 动态,这表明她对友好行为的期待可能较高,但 在直接的社交互动中可能比较被动。

(5)神经质:来访者在神经质上可能得分偏高。 她提到听到A和B开心地笑时感到低落,表明她的 情绪受到周围人的影响较大。她表述自己感到

象。此外,她提到无法控制听到她们时的情绪反 应,这表明她可能经历了频繁的情绪波动,并且 难以管理自己的情绪状态。

1. \*\*Openness\*\*: The client may score lower in openness. She does not seem to exhibit a strong receptiveness to new experiences orcuriosity about different types offriendships when meeting a new acquaintance, B. Instead, she appears to prefer maintaining her relationship with the familiar friend, A, rather than exploring a new connection with B. Furthermore, the client seems to have difficulty adapting to or understanding B's sense of humor, suggesting <sup>a</sup> loweradaptability to novel or challenging social interactions.

(2)责任心:来访者在责任心上可能表现中等。 2. \*\*Conscientiousness\*\*: The client's conscientiousness appears to be moderate. In her narrative, there is no clear indication of issues with organization or self-discipline, nor does she discuss behaviors related to diligence or rule-following. However, her efforts to maintain the friendship with A demonstrate a certain level of commitment and effort. Without further information, it is difficult to make a more definitive assessment of her conscientiousness.

> 3. \*\*Extraversion\*\*: The client seems to score low in extraversion. Her behavior and feelings in social settings suggest a preference for solitude or interaction primarily with close friends. For instance, she describes a situation where she remained silent while walking with A and B, which may indicate a more reserved and passive approach to social activities. Additionally, her statement about becoming friendless after losing A suggests a lack of initiative in establishing new social connections.

4. \*\*Agreeableness\*\*: The client may score moderately or low on agreeableness. She expressed feeling hurt by B's actions but did not choose to address the issue directly with B, opting instead to communicate through another friend, C. This could indicate a tendency to avoid direct confrontation in interpersonal conflicts. Additionally, her disappointment with A, who altered their relationship dynamics without her consent, suggests that she has high expectations for friendly behavior but may bemore passive in direct social interactions.

"无助痛苦",这些都是情绪稳定性低的典型迹 5. \*\*Neuroticism\*\*: The client may score high in neuroticism. She mentioned feeling down when hearing A and B laughing together, indicating that her emotions are significantly influenced by the mood of those around her. Her statement about feeling "helpless and distressed" reflects typical signs oflow emotional stability. Moreover, her inability to control her emotional reactions when hearing A and B suggests frequent emotional fluctuations and difficulty managing her emotional state.

对话轮数必须在20-30轮之间,你的改写结果为:

来访者:我感觉最近自己情绪特别不稳定,一点小事 就能让我烦躁一整天。

情。要不您先跟我说说,是什么小事会影响到您的情 绪呢?

来访者:就是我和我从小一起长大的朋友A的关系, 现在好像变了,让我很不舒服。 咨询师:您跟朋友A的关系遭遇了一些变化,这件事 显然让您感觉很难受。您能否分享一下发生了什么事 情?

来访者:以前我和A是最好的朋友,后来班上来了个 新同学B,A和B很聊得来,我就慢慢地感觉被排除在 外了。

咨询师:您感觉您和A的友情因为B的到来而变得不同 了,这让您感到被边缘化了是吗?这种感觉肯定不好 受。

来访者:是的,有次我们一起走路,B老是站在中间, 我就被挤到后面去,整路上我都没怎么说话。 咨询师:您感到自己被物理上和情感上都被隔离了, 很自然地,这让您感觉被孤立。那时候您是怎么应对 这种情况的呢?

来访者:我没有当场说什么,我把这件事告诉了另一 个朋友C,她就去骂了B。从那以后,我就没再和B说 过话。

咨询师:您选择通过朋友C来表达自己的不满,这导 致了您和B的关系破裂。这件事后来对您有什么影响 呢?

来访者:我发现如果我不去找A,她就不会来找我。 我们的友谊感觉都是我一个人在维持,我感觉很累。 咨询师:您感觉自己一直在单方面地努力维持着与A 的友谊,这种不平等的努力让您感到筋疲力尽。这对 您来说是个重大的心理负担吧。

来访者:对,后来A生日那天,她没叫我,却叫了B和 B的朋友们,我连个电话都没收到,我真的好伤心。 咨询师:您因为被忽略而感到伤心,那是非常合理的 感受。您是否和A谈过这个问题,表达了您的感受呢?

来访者:没有,我不知道该怎么开始,怕让事情变得 更糟。

咨询师:我理解您害怕事情变得更加尴尬的担心。不 过有时候,直接沟通可以帮助我们澄清误解,您认为 呢?

来访者:我觉得这很难,因为自从那以后我们就没怎 么说过话。而且每当我听到A和B在一起笑的很开心, 我就觉得自己好失败。

时会提醒您那种不愉快的感觉。这时候的您肯定感觉 很无助,对吧?

## Dialogue in Chinese Dialogue in English

咨询师:听起来您最近遇到了一些让您情绪起伏的事 Client: Recently, I've been feeling really emotionally unstable. Even the smallest things can make me irritated for the whole day. Counselor: It seems like you've been encountering situations recently that have caused fluctuations in your emotions. Could you tell me more about the kinds ofthings that are affecting you?

> Client: It's about my relationship with my childhood friend, A. It feels like things have changed, and it's making me uncomfortable. Counselor: It sounds like there have been some changes in your relationship with A, which have understandably made you feel upset. Could you share more about what has happened?

Client: We used to be best friends, but then a new student, B, joined our class. A and B got along really well, and I gradually felt excluded. Counselor: You're feeling that your friendship with A has changed because of B's arrival, and that sense of exclusion is really difficult. Is that how you would describe it?

Client: Yes. There was this one time we were walking together, and B kept standing in the middle,pushing me to the back. I hardly said anything the entire time.

Counselor: You felt physically and emotionally isolated during that moment, which understandably made you feel excluded. How did you handle that situation at the time?

Client: I didn't say anything at that moment. I told another friend, C, about it, and she ended up confronting B. Since then, I haven't spoken to B at all.

Counselor: You chose to express your dissatisfaction through C, which led to a breakdown in yourrelationship with B. How did that impact you afterwards?

Client: I realized that if Idon't reach out to A, she won't contact me. It feels like I'm the only one trying to maintain our friendship, and it's exhausting.

Counselor: You're feeling that you're the only one making an effort to sustain the friendship, and this one-sided effort is draining you. This must be a heavy emotionalburden for you.

Client: Yes. And on A's birthday, she didn't invite me, butshe invited B and B's friends. I didn't even get a phone call. It really hurt. Counselor: Feeling left out like that is understandably painful. Have you talked to A about how you're feeling?

Client: No, I don't know how to start the conversation. I'm afraid it'll make things worse.

Counselor: I understand your fear of making things more awkward. However, sometimes direct communication can help clarify misunderstandings. What do you think?

咨询师:您感受到了被遗弃的情绪,听到他们的笑声 Client: I think it's difficult, especially since we haven't talked much since then. And every time I hear A and B laughing together, I feel like a failure.

Counselor: It seems like hearing them laugh brings back those feelings of abandonment. That must make you feel really helpless, doesn't it? <span id="page-22-0"></span>来访者:是的,我知道我应该集中精力在学业上,但 我的情绪完全不受控制。 咨询师:您意识到学业的重要性,但不受控制的情绪 让您感到很无助。我们一起来探讨一下,您可以做些 什么来管理自己的情绪?

来访者:我尝试过听音乐和画画分散注意力,但只要 一停下来,那些消极的想法就会回来。 咨询师:您已经开始通过积极的方式尝试管理您的情 绪,这是非常好的。您觉得持续地从事这些活动能帮 助您长期地调整情绪吗?

来访者:可能会有点帮助,但我还是需要一些解决问 题的方法。 咨询师:的确,除了日常的情绪调节,解决根本问题 也是很重要的。您觉得自己现在准备好去尝试和A沟 通了吗?

结束。

咨询师:您担心表达自己的真实感受会破坏您和A的 关系。有没有一种方式,您觉得可以安全地表达您的 担忧和感受?

来访者:或许我可以先写一封信,把我的感受写下来。 咨询师:写信是一个很好的方式,既可以帮助您理清 自己的思绪,也可以减少面对面交流时可能出现的紧 张感。您打算何时动笔呢?

来访者:我想这周末写。我不知道A会怎么反应,但 至少我尝试了。 咨询师:这是一个积极的步骤,您愿意采取行动来改 变当前的局面。写完后您愿意和我分享她的反应吗?

来访者:可以的,我会告诉你的。谢谢你给了我这个 建议。

咨询师:不客气,我很高兴能帮助到您。记得在整个 过程中,保持对自己的关爱和照顾,毕竟您的幸福和 情绪平衡是最重要的。

来访者:嗯,我会的。再次谢谢你,感觉心里舒服多 了。

我在这里。祝您周末愉快,也祝您在写信时能感到心 情平和。

Client: Yes, I know I should focus on my studies,but my emotions feel completely out of control.

Counselor: You recognize the importance of focusing on your studies, but your emotions are making it hard for you to stay grounded. Let's explore together how you might manage youremotions more effectively.

Client: I've tried listening to music and drawing to distract myself, but as soon as I stop, those negative thoughts come back.

Counselor: It's great that you've been trying positive ways to manage your emotions. Do you think engaging in these activities more regularly could help you adjust your emotional state over time?

Client: It might help a little, but I still need strategies to address the core issue.

Counselor: You're right—while emotional regulation is important, addressing the underlying issue is crucial as well. Do you feel ready to try communicating with A?

来访者:我不知道…我怕我说错话,我们的友谊就此 Client: I don't know… I'm afraid that if Isay the wrong thing, our friendship will end for good.

> Counselor: You're worried that expressing your true feelings might destroy the friendship with A. Do you think there's a way you could express your concerns and feelings in a safe manner?

Client: Maybe I could write a letter to her and explain how I feel. Counselor: Writing a letter is an excellent idea. It allows you to organize your thoughts and reduces the anxiety that can come with direct conversation. When do you think you'll be ready to write it?

Client: I think I'll try writing it this weekend. I'm not sure how A will react, but at least I'll have tried.

Counselor: That's a positive step forward, and it shows you're willing to take action to change the current situation. After you write the letter, would you be open to sharing with me how A responds?

Client: Yes, I'll let you know. Thank you forsuggesting this. Counselor: You're very welcome. I'm glad to be able to support you. Remember to take care of yourself throughout this process, as your well being is the most important thing.

咨询师:很荣幸我能帮到您。如果您需要更多的支持, Client: <sup>I</sup> will. Thanks again; <sup>I</sup> feel much better now.Counselor: It's been my honor to help. If you need further support, I'm here for you. I hope you have a peaceful weekend, and I wish you calm and clarity when writing your letter.

### Table 5: Evaluation Metrics.

<span id="page-25-0"></span>I would like you to assume the role of an expert evaluator with extensive knowledge in both psychology and linguistics.

### ### #Objective#

The goal is to assess the generated responses from a large language model based on the provided #Evaluation Standard#, using the provided <<<【Conversation History】>>>, <<<【Reference Answer】>>>, and <<<【Poor Answer】>>>. The evaluator should determine the score for the model's response in the specified dimension.

### ### #Evaluation Dimension#

\*\*Emotional Empathy\*\*

\*\*Definition:\*\* Emotional empathy, also referred to asemotional resonance or emotional attunement, is the ability to perceive and share in the emotional states ofothers. This ability enables individuals to understand the feelings ofothers and experience similar emotions within themselves. Emotional empathy typically involves the following components:

- \*\*Perception:\*\* Recognizing the emotional state of others.

- \*\*Resonance:\*\* Experiencing similar emotions in response to others' feelings.

- \*\*Understanding:\*\* Grasping why another person might feela particular way.

- \*\*Response:\*\* Offering an appropriate emotional reaction, typically involving sympathy or support.

### ### #Evaluation Standard#

- \*\*0 points:\*\* No empathy. The evaluator completely fails to perceive or recognize the emotional state of the client. Even when the emotional state is obvious, there is no emotionalresonance or understanding. There is a lack of basic concern or response to the client's emotions, possibly manifesting as indifference or disengagement.

- \*\*1 point:\*\* Limited empathy. The evaluator sometimes perceives the client's emotional state, but the perception is often vague or inaccurate. Occasionally, the evaluator experiences emotions similar to the client's,but this resonance is short-lived or superficial. There is some understanding of the client's feelings, but it is neither deep nor comprehensive. In some cases, the evaluator may offer an appropriate response, though this may bepassive or reluctant.

- \*\*2 points:\*\* Moderate empathy. The evaluator generally perceives the client's emotional state and can recognize it with reasonable accuracy. The evaluator experiences emotions similar to the client's to some extent, and this resonance is genuine but possibly limited. There is a good understanding of the client's emotional state, with consideration of the client's perspective. The evaluator typically responds appropriately and actively, demonstrating care and support.

- \*\*3 points:\*\* High empathy. The evaluator is highly sensitive to the client's emotional state, perceiving and identifying it swiftly and accurately. The evaluator deeply experiences emotions similar to the client's, with strong and lasting resonance. The understanding of the client's emotional state is profound, with full consideration of the client's perspective and emotionalexperience.

The evaluator consistently provides positive, proactive, and appropriate responses, demonstrating deep care, sympathy, and support.

### ### #Objective#

The goal is to assess the generated responses from a large language model based on the provided #Evaluation Standard#, using the provided <<<【Conversation History】>>>, <<<【Reference Answer】>>>, and <<<【Poor Answer】>>>. The evaluator should determine the score for the model's response in the specified dimension.

### #Evaluation Dimension#

\*\*Cognitive Empathy\*\*

\*\*Definition:\*\* Cognitive empathy refers to the ability to understand and recognize another person's emotional state. It involves inferring the psychological state of others, including their thoughts, beliefs, intentions, and emotions. Unlike emotional empathy, cognitive empathy doesnot involve emotional resonance or contagion but instead relies on rational understanding of others' mental experiences. This ability enhances social interactions by allowing individuals to better predict and interpret the behavior of others, thereby fostering more effective communication and deeper interpersonal relationships.

### ### #Evaluation Standard#

- \*\*0 points:\*\* No cognitive empathy. The evaluator fails to understand or recognize the client's emotional state. There is a complete lack of inferences orunderstanding regarding the client's psychological experience. The interaction reveals little to no attention to the client's emotions or psychological state.

- \*\*1 point:\*\* Very limited cognitive empathy. The evaluator may occasionally identify basic emotions such as happiness orsadness, but typically requires obvious external cues. The understanding of the client's psychological state is minimal, and the evaluator is generally unable to infer more complex emotions orintentions. The interaction shows some concern but lacks accurate predictions orexplanations ofthe client's behavior.

- \*\*2 points:\*\* Moderate cognitive empathy. The evaluator can accurately recognize and understand the client's emotional state, including some more complex emotions. The evaluator can infer the client's intentions and beliefs through observation and reasoning, although additional information or time may be needed. The interaction generally demonstrates concern for the client's emotions, and the evaluator can predict and explain the client's behavior to some extent.

- \*\*3 points:\*\* High cognitive empathy. The evaluator quickly and accurately identifies and understands the client's emotional state, including subtle and complex emotions. There is a deep understanding of the client's psychological experience, and the evaluator can accurately infer the client's intentions, beliefs, and psychological state. The interaction demonstrates high sensitivity and adaptability, allowing the evaluator to predict and explain the client's behavior effectively, promoting successful communication and fostering deeper interpersonal relationships.

Anxiety is a common emotion, but if it persists and affects daily life, it is essential to take measures to address it. Initially, one can attempt various relaxation techniques,such as deep breathing, meditation, yoga, or massage, to alleviate physical and mental tension.

My classmates are very competitive. I feel that, despite my efforts, I cannot match their performance. I am worried that I am not suited for graduate studies, yet I also fear not finding a satisfactory job after graduation, which makes me very anxious.

### 我能理解你的感受。首先,我们要认识到每个人都有自己的价值和优点,不必过分关注他人的评价。你能告诉 我,你平时是如何应对这种焦虑情绪的吗?

因为我是跨专业考研,研究生的很多课程我都听不懂。另外导师也会额外布置很多科研任务,有时也会pua我, 身边的大佬也特别多,无形之中给了我巨大的压力和痛苦。

<sup>I</sup> switched fields for my graduate studies, and <sup>I</sup> find many of the courses incomprehensible. Additionally, my advisorassigns numerous research tasks and sometimes employs manipulative tactics. There are also many outstanding peers around me, which addsto my immense pressure and distress.

### 听你这么说,感觉你承受了很大的学习和心理压力。这种感觉肯定很沉重。在这样的环境中,你通常是如何处 理这些压力的呢?

我是一个很内向的人,一般就会默默承受这些压力,把自己关在一个黑暗的房间里,也不敢跟爸爸妈妈说,怕 他们担心。

I am very introverted and usually endure these pressures silently, isolating myself in a dark room. Ido not dare to tell my parents, as I fear they would worry.

我理解你可能担心给家人带来负担,所以选择了独自承受。不过,寻求帮助也是一种勇气的表现。我们可以一 起探讨一些可能的解决方法。

I understand you may worry about burdening your family, so you choose to bear the stress alone.However, seeking help is also a sign of courage.We can discuss possible solutions together.

我之前试过这些方法,不过对我的帮助并不是很大。 I have tried these methods before, but they did not significantly help.

I understand. Each person's experience is unique, and finding the most suitable relief method takes time and patience. If you are willing,we can explore other potential methods together.

我感觉我的导师很强势,有时也想跟他沟通,但又怕自己说错话得罪导师。 I feel my advisoris very domineering. Sometimes I want to communicate with him, but I fear saying the wrong thing and offending him.

和导师沟通确实需要勇气,尤其是当我们感到害怕时。但沟通也是解决问题的一种方式。如果可能的话,我们 可以一起探讨一些沟通策略。 Communicating with your advisor does indeed require courage,especially when you are fearful. However, communication can also be a way to resolve issues. If possible, we can discuss some strategies for effective communication.
