**Abstract:** Background/Objectives: Physical activity (PA) has many benefits for both physical and cognitive health. It has also been related to improvements in memory and executive functions. However, its impact on time estimation remains less explored. Time is a key component of episodic memory, which also involves spatial components to give a full context to events. Given the clear evidence of the benefits of PA in spatial navigation and the anatomical overlap with temporal estimation through the hippocampus, the latter could be affected in a similar way. Therefore, this study aimed to check how PA can influence time processing and spatial memory. We wanted to check if PA influenced time and space with the same directionality. **Methods:** Forty-two (*n* = 42) female university students participated in this study, divided into a Sport (*n* = 25) or Sedentary (*n*= 17) Group depending on their participation in PA for a minimum of 3 h a week. They were addressed in two different cognitive capabilities. The first was time processing, measured by the Time Comparison Task, which controlled for several key aspects of time literature in its design. Moreover, we measured spatial navigation skills, using a well-proven virtual spatial navigation task, The Boxes Room. Accuracy and mean response times were registered per task. **Results:** Significant correlations were observed between spatial and temporal task performance. In addition, PA influenced spatial and time processing in a similar way, with the Sport Group outperforming the Sedentary Group in accuracy and response times for both tasks. **Conclusions:** These findings provide evidence that PA influences time processing similarly to its established effects on spatial memory, which could help developing sports programs that further enhance this skill.

## 1. Introduction

Physical activity (PA) is widely considered a key component of an optimal state of health. It is a category that can include many activities, such as sports practice, alongside leisure activities, planned exercises, and dancing, having in common the involvement of a body movement with the contraction of skeletal muscles [1]. There is a considerable international impulse to promote a more active lifestyle in the population, as it can successfully prevent many chronic diseases and the consequences of a sedentary lifestyle [2,3]. Among the many benefits of PA, we can find a reduced risk of developing many organic diseases such as hypertension, obesity, and diabetes, among others [4,5]. PA can also help reduce the mental health risks for conditions such as depression [1].

However, the benefits are not only focused on preventing disease or improving the fitness of the body. A physically active lifestyle can also help enhance brain function in several populations. There are meta-analyses reporting a general benefit of PA in cognitive processes such as attention, motor control, or visuospatial memory [6,7]. Other studies show benefits in executive control [8], motor inhibition, and cognitive flexibility [9].

Moreover, PA results in clear improvements in learning tasks that are dependent on hippocampus learning, thus demanding the encoding of spatial signals that can form a cognitive map of the environment [10]. Therefore, physically active individuals are able to outperform sedentary participants in spatial navigation tasks in both animals [11,12] and humans [13–15]. This also
