| Exploring knowledge management from a software engineering perspective | Dilyan Georgiev | 2023 | No | High | This paper explores the intersection of knowledge management and software engineering, which is highly relevant to our research on PKGs for HDM. | | The software engineering (SE) knowledge domain is rapidly expanding due to new technologies and complex organizational processes. The software industry is a key area for Knowledge Management (KM) because of high employee turnover, extensive project outsourcing, and fast-paced technological innovations. KM can significantly impact the lifecycle of SE knowledge, improving how organizations create, transfer, and share it. In light of SE automation trends using AI, KM strategies can help companies and professionals rethink the future of SE work. This research investigates how KM principles can aid the transformation of software-related jobs, using a conceptual model and quantitative data from 91 software experts. It assesses the impact of both organizational and domain-specific SE knowledge to identify valuable SE processes and explore how AI can automate the field. The findings present models for structuring KM processes in SE at both technological and organizational levels. The paper also discusses suitable KM methods to support the evolution of SE jobs and identifies key integration practices, showing how combining KM with AI can enhance SE activities like team onboarding, documentation monitoring, version control, and error tracking. | How can knowledge management principles be applied to software engineering to improve knowledge creation, transfer, and sharing? | Conceptual model and quantitative data from 91 software experts | The paper presents models for structuring KM processes in SE at both technological and organizational levels. | The paper provides a framework for integrating KM and AI to enhance SE activities. | The paper is based on a conceptual model and a survey of software experts, and further empirical validation is needed. | The paper provides a valuable framework for integrating KM and AI in SE. | The paper highlights the need for more research on the practical implementation of KM and AI in SE. | Future work should focus on the empirical validation of the proposed models and the development of practical tools and methods for KM and AI in SE. | The paper provides valuable insights into the design of KM systems for SE. | https://papers.academic-conferences.org/index.php/eckm/article/view/1497 | 10.34190/eckm.24.2.1497 | KM, SE, AI, Knowledge Management, Software Engineering |
| The Use of AI in Software Engineering: A Synthetic Knowledge Synthesis of the Recent Research Literature | Peter Kokol | 2024 | No | Medium | This paper provides a broad overview of the use of AI in software engineering, which is relevant context for our research on PKGs for HDM. | | Artificial intelligence (AI) has witnessed an exponential increase in use in various applications. Recently, the academic community started to research and inject new AI-based approaches to provide solutions to traditional software-engineering problems. However, a comprehensive and holistic understanding of the current status needs to be included. To close the above gap, synthetic knowledge synthesis was used to induce the research landscape of the contemporary research literature on the use of AI in software engineering. The synthesis resulted in 15 research categories and 5 themes—namely, natural language processing in software engineering, use of artificial intelligence in the management of the software development life cycle, use of machine learning in fault/defect prediction and effort estimation, employment of deep learning in intelligent software engineering and code management, and mining software repositories to improve software quality. The most productive country was China (n = 2042), followed by the United States (n = 1193), India (n = 934), Germany (n = 445), and Canada (n = 381). A high percentage (n = 47.4%) of papers were funded, showing the strong interest in this research topic. The convergence of AI and software engineering can significantly reduce the required resources, improve the quality, enhance the user experience, and improve the well-being of software developers. | What is the current state of research on the use of AI in software engineering? | Synthetic knowledge synthesis | The paper identifies five main research themes in the use of AI in software engineering: NLP, AI in software development life cycle management, ML for fault prediction and effort estimation, deep learning for intelligent software engineering and code management, and mining software repositories to enhance software quality. | The paper provides a comprehensive overview of the research landscape of AI in software engineering. | The paper is a literature review and does not propose a specific solution. | The paper provides a valuable overview of the research landscape of AI in software engineering. | The paper highlights the need for more research on the practical implementation of AI in software engineering. | Future work should focus on the development of practical tools and methods for AI in software engineering. | The paper provides a good overview of the design considerations for AI-powered software engineering tools. | https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/6/354 | 10.3390/info15060354 | AI, SE, NLP, ML, Deep Learning, Software Engineering |

| Incremental Schema Integration for Data Wrangling via Knowledge Graphs | Javier Flores, Kashif Rabbani, Sergi Nadal, Cristina Gómez, Oscar Romero, Emmanuel Jamin, Stamatia Dasiopoulou | 2022 | No | High | This paper proposes a semi-automatic and incremental approach to schema integration, which is a core challenge in our research. | | Virtual data integration is the current approach to go for data wrangling in data-driven decision-making. In this paper, we focus on automating schema integration, which extracts a homogenised representation of the data source schemata and integrates them into a global schema to enable virtual data integration. Schema integration requires a set of well-known constructs: the data source schemata and wrappers, a global integrated schema and the mappings between them. Based on them, virtual data integration systems enable fast and on-demand data exploration via query rewriting. Unfortunately, the generation of such constructs is currently performed in a largely manual manner, hindering its feasibility in real scenarios. This becomes aggravated when dealing with heterogeneous and evolving data sources. To overcome these issues, we propose a fully-fledged semi-automatic and incremental approach grounded on knowledge graphs to generate the required schema integration constructs in four main steps: bootstrapping, schema matching, schema integration, and generation of system-specific constructs. We also present NextiaDI, a tool implementing our approach. Finally, a comprehensive evaluation is presented to scrutinize our approach. | How can schema integration be automated for data wrangling in virtual data integration systems? | The paper proposes a semi-automatic and incremental approach grounded on knowledge graphs. | The paper proposes a four-step approach to schema integration: bootstrapping, schema matching, schema integration, and generation of system-specific constructs.
