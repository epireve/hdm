# Design Patterns for Universal Personal Knowledge Graph Framework for Human Digital Twin (HDM)

## Introduction

# Developing a universal Personal Knowledge Graph (PKG) framework for Human Digital Memory (HDM) requires a comprehensive architectural approach that addresses the complex challenges of data capturing, storage, and retrieval while serving both researchers and end-users effectively\[1]. The framework must integrate multiple design patterns to handle the multifaceted nature of personal data, ensure privacy preservation, and provide scalable solutions for diverse use cases\[2]\[3].

## Core Architectural Patterns

### 1. Layered Architecture Pattern

# The foundation of a universal PKG framework should employ a **five-layer architecture** that provides modularity, scalability, security, and interoperability\[4]. This pattern, successfully demonstrated in healthcare digital twin implementations, includes:* **Data Collection Layer**: Captures multimodal data from various sources including IoT devices, applications, and user interactions\[5]
