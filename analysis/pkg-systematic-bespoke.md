This systematic review examines the current state of knowledge graph construction for personal data integration, digital twin technologies, and their intersection with large language models to assess the feasibility and research value of developing specialized frameworks for Human Digital Memory (HDM). The analysis reveals significant technical foundations in heterogeneous data integration and emerging opportunities in digital health applications, while identifying critical gaps in temporal-cognitive modeling and personalized data architectures that position this research area as both technically feasible and strategically valuable for advancing personalized digital services and health informatics.


## Current State of Knowledge Graph Construction Technologies

The foundation for heterogeneous data integration in knowledge graphs has matured significantly, with several robust frameworks demonstrating practical solutions for the challenges inherent in Human Digital Memory systems. The emergence of unified approaches to knowledge graph construction represents a critical advancement for HDM feasibility, as personal data inherently spans multiple formats, platforms, and semantic structures.

Recent developments in unified knowledge graph construction frameworks provide compelling evidence for technical feasibility. The Docs2KG framework demonstrates the ability to extract multimodal information from diverse and heterogeneous unstructured documents, including emails, web pages, PDF files, and Excel files, dynamically generating unified knowledge graphs\[3]. This capability directly addresses one of the core challenges in HDM systems, where personal data exists across disparate formats and requires seamless integration. The framework's flexibility and extensibility make it particularly suitable for adapting to various document structures and content types that characterize personal digital ecosystems.

The SPARQL Anything approach further strengthens the technical foundation by providing unified access methods for heterogeneous data sources through the Facade-X meta-model\[4]\[16]\[18]. This meta-model allows transformers to produce RDF from diverse data sources without requiring domain-specific vocabularies, offering a simplified approach to handling the complexity of personal data formats. The system's ability to transform any file format expressible in BNF syntax, as well as relational databases, into a unified RDF representation demonstrates the scalability required for comprehensive HDM implementations\[16]. The approach has demonstrated both theoretical soundness and practical performance advantages in terms of usability and cognitive complexity compared to traditional mapping languages.

These technological foundations address several critical requirements for HDM systems, including the ability to handle diverse data formats, maintain semantic consistency across heterogeneous sources, and provide scalable integration architectures. The proven effectiveness of these approaches in academic and industrial contexts provides strong evidence that the core technical challenges of HDM knowledge graph construction are solvable with current technologies.


### Integration Challenges and Solutions

The complexity of personal data integration extends beyond format diversity to include semantic alignment, temporal consistency, and privacy preservation. Current knowledge graph construction methods have developed sophisticated approaches to handle entity semantic differences and knowledge system variations across different data sources\[19]. The multimodal entity semantic fusion models based on vector features and system fusion frameworks demonstrate that semantic heterogeneity in personal data can be effectively managed through advanced integration techniques.

The emergence of LLM-assisted knowledge graph construction represents a particularly promising development for HDM applications. The integration of large language models with knowledge graph construction processes has shown significant improvements in handling unstructured text and extracting semantic relationships that might be missed by traditional approaches\[3]\[20]. This capability is essential for HDM systems, where much personal data exists in unstructured formats such as notes, communications, and social media content.


## Digital Human Twins and Healthcare Applications

The concept of Digital Human Twins has gained substantial traction in healthcare applications, providing a robust foundation for understanding the potential impact and utility of HDM systems. Digital Human Twins represent virtual replicas that encapsulate both medical and physiological characteristics, including tissues, organs, and biokinetic data of patients\[5]. This healthcare-focused application domain demonstrates the practical value and market demand for comprehensive digital representations of individuals.

Healthcare applications of digital twins have shown remarkable progress in enabling personalized medicine and treatment optimization. These systems facilitate deeper understanding of disease progression and enhance customization of treatment plans by modeling complex interactions between genetic factors and environmental influences\[5]. The bidirectional connections between physical and digital entities enable real-time data exchange, transforming traditional electronic health records into dynamic, predictive systems. This transformation demonstrates the potential impact of well-designed HDM systems beyond healthcare into broader life management and optimization domains.

The integration of extensive historical datasets from clinical trials and real-world sources with AI models has enabled comprehensive predictions of future health outcomes for specific patients\[5]. This predictive capability represents one of the most compelling value propositions for HDM systems, as it demonstrates how comprehensive personal data integration can enable actionable insights and personalized recommendations. The progression toward precision medicine and personalized health interventions provides a clear model for how HDM systems could deliver value across multiple life domains.

## Temporal and Cognitive Aspects of Knowledge Representation

The temporal dimension of personal data represents one of the most critical and complex aspects of HDM system design. Recent research in temporal knowledge graph enrichment has identified significant challenges in representing time-variant knowledge and relationships that are only valid for specific periods\[15]. Current large-scale knowledge graphs show substantial gaps in temporal coverage, with only 6.6% of facts being time-aware in major systems like YAGO3\[15]. This limitation represents both a significant challenge and a substantial opportunity for HDM systems that inherently deal with temporal data streams.

Temporal knowledge graph enrichment research has developed sophisticated approaches to address volume, completeness, and coverage challenges through temporal knowledge harvesting, completion, and alignment techniques\[15]. The extraction of temporal knowledge from free text using pattern-based systems and parse-tree-based methods has shown promising results for improving both accuracy and coverage of temporal relationships\[15]. These advances provide technical foundations that can be adapted for personal temporal data processing in HDM systems.

The cognitive aspects of knowledge representation have emerged as an equally important consideration for HDM systems. Cognitive information representation models based on knowledge graphs have demonstrated the ability to combine perceptual information with semantic description information to form structured, logically reasoned cognitive knowledge graphs\[19]. These models include both perception layers and cognition layers, enabling more sophisticated reasoning about personal experiences and behaviors.


### Advanced Temporal Modeling Approaches

The development of context-aware embedding models for temporal knowledge graphs has shown significant improvements in capturing temporal consistency and interactions across different time dimensions\[15]. These models measure how well entities interact with their surrounding contexts on temporal dimensions, providing frameworks that could be adapted for modeling personal temporal relationships and behavioral patterns in HDM systems.

Temporal knowledge graph completion techniques using context-based inference models have demonstrated effectiveness in inferring unknown time intervals and relationships\[15]. This capability is particularly relevant for HDM systems, where personal data often contains gaps or incomplete temporal information that must be inferred from available context. The ability to predict and complete temporal relationships could significantly enhance the utility and comprehensiveness of personal knowledge graphs.


## LLM Integration with Knowledge Graphs

The integration of Large Language Models with knowledge graph systems has opened new possibilities for intelligent interaction and reasoning over complex information stores. Recent developments in LLM-based agents with episodic memory demonstrate the potential for sophisticated personal information management systems\[17]. The AriGraph method shows how agents can construct and update memory graphs that integrate semantic and episodic memories while exploring environments, providing a model for how HDM systems could enable intelligent personal assistance.

LLM integration with knowledge graphs has shown particular promise in knowledge graph population and completion tasks. Task-specific pre-training approaches combined with prompt decomposition techniques have achieved significant improvements in knowledge graph population from language models\[20]. The winning system in the LM-KBC challenge achieved 55.0% F-1 score on knowledge base construction tasks, demonstrating the maturity of LLM-KG integration techniques.

The combination of LLM capabilities with structured knowledge representations addresses several key challenges in HDM systems, including natural language interface design, intelligent query processing, and automated knowledge extraction from unstructured personal data. The ability of LLMs to understand context and generate relevant responses while leveraging structured knowledge provides a compelling interaction model for personal digital memory systems.


### Agent-Based Interaction Models

The development of LLM agents with structured memory architectures has demonstrated effective handling of complex tasks within interactive environments\[17]. These agents outperform traditional memory methods and strong reinforcement learning baselines across various complexity levels, indicating the potential for sophisticated personal digital assistants built on HDM foundations. The competitive performance compared to dedicated knowledge graph-based methods in multi-hop question-answering scenarios suggests that LLM-KG hybrid approaches could provide superior user experiences in personal information management.

The integration of planning and decision-making capabilities with memory graph architectures has shown promise for handling tasks difficult even for human players\[17]. This level of capability suggests that HDM systems integrated with LLM agents could provide substantial value in complex personal task management, decision support, and life optimization scenarios.


## Technical Feasibility Assessment

The demonstrated success of heterogeneous data integration frameworks provides proven approaches for handling the diverse data sources inherent in personal digital ecosystems\[3]\[4]\[16].

The scalability requirements for HDM systems are addressable through existing distributed architectures and cloud-based knowledge graph platforms. The Docs2KG framework's ability to handle multimodal information extraction from diverse document types demonstrates that current technologies can support the data volumes and variety expected in comprehensive personal data systems\[3]. The framework's public accessibility and demonstration implementations provide concrete starting points for HDM system development.

The semantic integration challenges posed by personal data heterogeneity have been addressed through advanced entity fusion models and system integration frameworks\[19]. The proven effectiveness of these approaches in industrial Internet environments suggests that similar techniques can be successfully adapted for personal data domains. The development of cognitive information representation models provides additional evidence that complex personal data relationships can be effectively captured and reasoned about within knowledge graph frameworks.


### Implementation Considerations

The development of HDM systems faces several implementation challenges that require careful architectural design. Data privacy and security concerns are paramount given the sensitive nature of personal information, but healthcare digital twin implementations have demonstrated that these challenges can be addressed through appropriate technical safeguards\[5]. The healthcare domain's regulatory requirements have driven the development of privacy-preserving architectures that can be adapted for broader personal data applications.

The development of cognitive-inspired knowledge representation models specifically for personal data represents a novel research direction with potential for significant theoretical contributions\[19].

The intersection of knowledge graphs, digital twins, and LLM technologies represents an emerging research area with high potential for innovation. The demonstrated effectiveness of LLM-agent systems with structured memory suggests that HDM research could contribute to advances in artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, and personalized computing\[17]. The potential for HDM systems to serve as foundations for future AI applications provides additional research motivation beyond immediate practical applications.


### Societal and Economic Impact

The potential societal impact of HDM systems extends across multiple domains, including healthcare, education, productivity enhancement, and personal development. The precision medicine model demonstrated in healthcare digital twins provides a template for how comprehensive personal data integration could enable personalized services across other life domains\[5]. The ability to predict future outcomes and optimize interventions based on personal data patterns could transform approaches to education, career development, and life planning.

The economic impact potential is significant given the growing market for personalized services and the increasing value of personal data in digital economies.
